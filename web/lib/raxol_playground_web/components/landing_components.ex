  # 1. Hero demo: one module, four surfaces
  #
  # The four panes are four encodings of ONE render, all projected from the
  # same `Raxol.Headless` session, the way `Raxol.Harness.Surface.Parity`
  # projects a fixture onto cells, LiveView DOM, SSH ANSI and MCP JSON. Every
  # picture and every listing comes from a committed artifact (see
  # `RaxolPlayground.SurfaceSource`); what a pane puts AROUND one is chrome, in
  # the same sense the `$ mix run` line and the window dots above it are. The
  # browser pane's URL bar and page furniture are that chrome, and the frame
  # inside them is the recording.
  #
  # No ACP tab. ACP is the coding agent's editor protocol, not a surface a
  # TEA module renders to, so a pane captioned "pulse, driven over ACP" would
  # describe a program that does not exist. It has its own page.
  #
  # All four panes are server-rendered; the HeroDemo hook only toggles
  # `hidden`/aria-selected, auto-advancing tabs and stepping the recorded
  # frames on a fixed-timestep rAF accumulator. Clicking a tab stops the
  # auto-advance. Switching examples re-mounts the hook (the element id
  # carries the example name).

    ~H"""
    <%!-- A stable id for the child `main` actually holds, because the demo's own
         id deliberately changes per example (below) and morphdom keys `main`'s
         children by id. A rekeyed hero is an insert, and inserting it displaces
         the sibling that follows -- the integrations row -- which detaches and
         reattaches it. Reattaching an element restarts its CSS animation, so the
         marquee jumped back to its first frame on every "next example".

         The shell contains the churn: `main`'s three children now keep the same
         identity across a switch, and only the hero's own subtree is rekeyed.
         `.hero-demo-shell` is `display: contents`, so it generates no box and
         `.hero-demo` remains a direct flex child of `.screen-main`. --%>
    <div id="hero-demo-shell" class="hero-demo-shell">
      <%!-- The id carries the example so switching remounts the hook: the frame
           player caches its frame nodes, and patching them underneath it would
           leave it stepping elements that no longer exist. --%>
      <div
        id={"hero-demo-#{@example}"}

      >
      <%!-- The player's controls live in the title bar, where a window's
           controls belong and where nothing can clip them. They used to sit in
           a footer below the panes: the demo box is height-capped, so on any
           viewport too short for the one-screen layout the panes overflowed it
           and `overflow: hidden` swallowed the footer whole -- the pause button
           and the example switcher were unreachable, and scrolling did not help
           because they were clipped in place rather than below the fold. --%>
      <%!-- No window dots. `terminal_chrome/1` in PlaygroundComponents already
           made this call for the rest of the site -- its docstring says it
           drops the fake mac-style red/yellow/green dots for a shell prompt
           that earns its place -- and this bar had put them back. The frames
           below are real recorded output; three grey discs above them are the
           one thing here pretending to be a window. --%>
      <div class="hero-demo-bar">
        <span class="hd-prompt" aria-hidden="true">$</span>
        <%!-- Two spans, because they answer different questions and only one
             of them changes: which program this is (static, and the thing a
             reader loses track of while clicking through surfaces) and which
             surface it is rendering to (rewritten by the tab). --%>
        <%!-- The blurb is its own span so a narrow bar can drop it whole. As
             one string it ellipsed at ~12 characters, spending a row of the
             bar to render "one ..." -- the filename is the part that has to
             survive, and .hd-title already drops itself on the same grounds. --%>
        <%!-- The filename is the link to the file. The pane tells you to
             `mix run pulse.exs`; this is where pulse.exs comes from, and
             hanging it on the name costs the bar no width. `download` because
             the click's job is to put that file on disk, not to open a page
             of source; the arrow says so at rest, where an underline only
             appears on hover. A line of its own below the demo would say it
             better, but the one-screen budget has no row to give and this
             box's overflow clips anything appended to it. --%>
        <span class="hd-name"><a
            href={"/examples/#{@title}"}
            class="hd-file"

        <span class="hd-title" data-role="title">rendering to the terminal</span>

        <%!-- Ruled off from the captions beside them. The bar reads left to
             right as one run of small mono text, so the two things that are
             actually clickable were indistinguishable from the sentence that
             ends just before them. The transport is a glyph now (`||` and the
             pipe, which the mono stack always has, where a media glyph would
             be a font gamble) and the switcher wears a border, so the bar has
             one label, one icon and one button rather than four phrases. --%>

      <%!-- A real tablist, not four buttons wearing the role. Each tab names
           the panel it controls and only the selected one is in the tab order,
           which is what makes the arrow keys the hook binds the way you move
           between them: the pattern promises a reader that Tab leaves the group
           and the arrows walk it, and half of it announces a selection with
           nothing to step into. The ids carry the example name because the
           whole demo remounts when the example switches, and two mounts sharing
           an id would cross-wire the aria-controls. --%>

  One hero example as a file that actually runs.

  The pane heads itself `$ mix run pulse.exs` and shows the program running,
  but what it lists is a bare `defmodule`: `mix run` defines it and exits
  without drawing anything. A reader who copied what was on screen got silence,
  which made the command line above it the one claim in this hero that was not
  true.

  The two lines that fix it are not in the listing. The pane is already
  type-starved -- the one-screen layout fits a 30-line module at about 9px, and
  three more lines take it to the 8px floor -- so the boot is served with the
  file instead of spent on the reader's ability to read the program.

  It is GENERATED from the module the source declares, so the line that starts
  the app cannot come to name a different module than the one above it.
  `Raxol.run/2` is not a shorter spelling: it delegates to `start_link/2` and
  returns immediately, whatever its docs say.
