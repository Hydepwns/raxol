defmodule RaxolPlayground.BrandMarks do
  @moduledoc """
  Brand marks for the integrations row, inlined at compile time.

  The SVGs in `priv/brand_marks/` are read here once, reduced to the single
  path each carries, and baked into the module, so a render costs a map lookup
  and the page makes no external request for a logo. `priv/brand_marks/README.md`
  records where they came from, their licence, and why one entry has none.

  The map is keyed by the DISPLAY NAME the row derives, not by file name, so
  the marks answer to the row rather than the other way round: most keys come
  from the provider registry, and the rest have to be entries the row renders
  or a test fails them as marks that outlived the thing they name.
  An entry with no mark is not an error: `path/1` returns `nil` and the row
  shows its name, which is what a newly added backend does until someone adds
  one. `known/0` exists so a test can hold every key against the derived
  entries and catch a mark that outlives the thing it names.

  # stand-in. OpenAI, VS Code, Grok and LongCat come from vendor-published
  # assets normalized to this directory's shape (the README records each
