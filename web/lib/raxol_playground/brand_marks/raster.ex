defmodule RaxolPlayground.BrandMarks.Raster do
  @moduledoc """
  Renders one of the brand-mark paths as terminal cells.

  The integrations row inlines a mark as SVG, which a browser scales freely.
  A terminal has no such freedom: the smallest thing it can draw is a cell,
  so a mark reaching a terminal surface has to be resampled onto a grid of
  them. Braille carries the most detail per cell of any glyph block a
  monospace font reliably has (two by four dots), which is what makes a mark
  legible at three rows rather than at eight.

  This is a rendering of the artwork, not a redrawing of it. The path comes
  from the same official file `RaxolPlayground.BrandMarks` extracts for the
  page, it is scaled uniformly, and nothing is added to it. Choosing the grid
  is the caller's job and the only place proportion can be lost: a terminal
  cell is taller than it is wide, so an undistorted mark that is `rows` tall
  needs `aspect * rows * cell_aspect` columns, and rounding that to a whole
  number is what a caller has to keep small. `aspect/1` reports the number so
  the caller can check rather than guess.

  Only `M`, `L`, `H`, `V`, `C` and `Z` are understood, in both cases. An arc
  or a smooth-curve shorthand raises: its control points do not survive a
  naive coordinate scale, and a quietly wrong glyph is worse than a build
  error. The one mark this module is asked for uses `M`, `L`, `C` and `Z`,
  which is the same reason the refit that produced that file could be exact.

  Rasterize `path` onto a `cols` by `rows` grid of braille cells.

  Options:

    * `:cols`, `:rows` -- the cell grid, required. See the module doc on
      picking a pair that does not distort the mark.
    * `:fill_rule` -- `"evenodd"` or `nil` for SVG's `nonzero` default. A
      mark whose counter is wound the same way as its outer contour fills in
      solid under the wrong rule, which is a redrawn logo.
    * `:threshold` -- coverage a dot must reach to be set, default `0.3`.
      Low, because at this size most dots on the mark's edge are partial and
      a half-covered dot reads better set than clear.

  Every returned row is padded to `cols`, so the caller gets a rectangle it
  can place in a layout rather than ragged lines.

  Width over height of `path`'s artwork, ignoring the canvas around it.

  third of the grid empty and the mark smaller than the row it sits in.
