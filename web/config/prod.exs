# to set PORT=80 before running your server.

# You should also configure the url host to something
# meaningful, we use this information when generating URLs.

# Note we also include the path to a cache manifest
# containing the digested version of static files. This
# manifest is generated by the `mix assets.deploy` task,
# which you should run after static files are built and
# before starting your production server.
