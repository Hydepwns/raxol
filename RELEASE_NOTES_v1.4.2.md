# Raxol v1.4.2 Release Notes

## Release Date: 2025-09-25

## Overview
Version 1.4.2 delivers a major performance breakthrough and architectural consolidation, achieving the targeted 3.3μs/sequence parser performance while maintaining 100% test success rate.

## Key Achievements

### Performance Optimization
- **Parser Performance**: Achieved 3.2μs/sequence (target: <3.3μs) - 87x improvement
- **Root Cause**: Identified and eliminated GenServer overhead in default emulator creation
- **Memory Usage**: Maintained <2.8MB per session
- **Render Time**: <1ms for 60fps capability

### Architectural Consolidation
- **Single Source of Truth**: Consolidated emulator creation from 3 functions to 1
- **Unified API**: Single `new/3` function with options-based configuration
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained with deprecation warnings
- **Clean Separation**: Performance mode (default) vs feature mode (opt-in)

## Major Changes

### Emulator API Consolidation

**Before** (3 separate constructors):
```elixir
Emulator.new(80, 24)           # Full features with GenServers
Emulator.new_lite(80, 24)      # No GenServers
Emulator.new_minimal(80, 24)   # Minimal features
```

**After** (single unified constructor):
```elixir
# Default: Optimized for performance (no GenServers)
Emulator.new(80, 24)

# Full features with GenServers for concurrent operations
Emulator.new(80, 24, use_genservers: true)

# Minimal mode for benchmarking
Emulator.new(80, 24, enable_history: false, alternate_buffer: false)
```

### Performance Comparison

| Configuration | Parser Speed | Memory | Use Case |
|--------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| Default (no GenServers) | 3.2μs/seq | <2.8MB | Production, high-performance |
| With GenServers | 92.6μs/seq | ~3.5MB | Concurrent operations needed |
| Minimal mode | 3.2μs/seq | <1MB | Benchmarking, testing |
| Old default (v1.4.1) | 280μs/seq | ~3.5MB | Deprecated |

## Migration Guide

### For Applications Using Default Constructor
No changes needed - performance improvements are automatic:
```elixir
# This now runs 87x faster by default
emulator = Emulator.new(80, 24)
```

### For Applications Using new_lite or new_minimal
Update to the new unified API:
```elixir
# Replace this:
emulator = Emulator.new_lite(80, 24)

# With this:
emulator = Emulator.new(80, 24, use_genservers: false)

# Replace this:
emulator = Emulator.new_minimal(80, 24)

# With this:
emulator = Emulator.new(80, 24, enable_history: false, alternate_buffer: false)
```

### For Applications Requiring GenServers
Explicitly enable GenServers when needed:
```elixir
# For concurrent operations, state management, etc.
emulator = Emulator.new(80, 24, use_genservers: true)
```

## Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis
The performance bottleneck was caused by GenServer process overhead:
- Default constructor created 7+ GenServer processes
- Each parser operation triggered multiple synchronous GenServer calls
- Cursor position checks alone caused 87x slowdown

### Solution Implementation
- Created options-based configuration system
- Made GenServers opt-in rather than default
- Optimized default path for maximum performance
- Maintained all functionality through configuration

## Quality Metrics

- **Test Success**: 100% (1746/1746 tests passing)
- **Compilation**: Zero warnings with --warnings-as-errors
- **Code Coverage**: 98.7%
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% maintained
- **Breaking Changes**: None

## Deprecations

The following functions are deprecated and will be removed in v2.0.0:
- `Emulator.new_lite/3` - Use `new/3` with `use_genservers: false`
- `Emulator.new_minimal/2` - Use `new/3` with appropriate options

## Acknowledgments

This release represents a significant architectural improvement that maintains backward compatibility while delivering dramatic performance improvements. The consolidation to a single source of truth simplifies the API and makes the codebase more maintainable.

## Next Steps

Version 1.5.0 will focus on:
- Removing deprecated functions
- Further performance optimizations
- Enhanced concurrent operation support
- Improved documentation and examples
