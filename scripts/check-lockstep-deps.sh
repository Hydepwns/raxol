#
# Guard against lagging inter-package version constraints.
#
# Every raxol_* package declares its sibling deps with a "~> X.Y" constraint.
# When the family is bumped (say 2.5 -> 2.6) but a dependent still says
# "~> 2.4", HEX_BUILD resolves the stale *published* sibling (2.4.0) instead of
# the new one, so the package is built and published against incompatible code.
# That is exactly how a 2.6.0 publish ended up compiling against raxol_core
# 2.4.0 and failing under Elixir 1.20.
#
# The same constraint appears in prose: every README and install snippet tells a
# reader which version to depend on, and those drift silently because nothing
# resolves them. A stale snippet points users at an old published package.
#
# This check fails if any raxol_* dependency constraint's minor version does not
# match the current version of the package it points at, in mix.exs files and in
# tracked Markdown. Run it in CI and before publishing.
#
# CHANGELOG and migration docs are exempt: they describe past versions on
# purpose.
#
# Written for bash 3.2 (macOS default): no associative arrays.
