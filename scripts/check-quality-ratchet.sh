# Quality ratchet. Compares current gate counts against the checked-in
# baseline in priv/quality_baseline.json and fails when a count has
# INCREASED. Lowering a count is always allowed; run with --update to record
# the improvement.
#
# Why a ratchet and not a pass/fail bar: the gates are not clean, and pinning
# them to zero would mean either a permanently red pipeline or the `|| true`
# suppression this script exists to replace. A ratchet makes the trend
# enforceable without a big-bang cleanup.
#
# Why the counts live here and not in AGENTS.md: a number in prose has nothing
# validating it. AGENTS.md claimed "Credo strict: 0 issues, Dialyzer clean"
# while both gates were non-blocking and neither result was read by the status
# gate. This file is machine-owned and machine-updated.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MEASUREMENT INTEGRITY
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A ratchet is only as good as its ability to tell "the tool ran and found N"
# apart from "the tool did not run". Getting that wrong makes the gate PASS on
# a broken build, which is strictly worse than no gate. Three separate bugs of
# exactly that shape were found in earlier revisions of this script:
#
#   1. `mix dialyzer ... 2>/dev/null | grep -c` -- dialyxir writes findings to
#      STDERR, so the count was always 0 and every run read as a perfect score.
#   2. Baselining dialyxir's "Total errors:" line, which is the count BEFORE
#      .dialyzer_ignore.exs is applied, so a landed suppression was invisible.
#   3. `grep -c` emits "0" and exits 1 when nothing matches. With no `set -e`,
#      a crashed/OOM/compile-failed tool produced count=0 -> "IMPROVED" ->
#      exit 0 on a blocking gate.
#
# The rule that prevents all three: EVERY gate must extract its count from a
# COMPLETION MARKER that only a finished run can produce, and must abort if
# that marker is absent. Never infer a count from the absence of output.
#
#   * credo    -> `--format json`; the marker is a parseable document with an
#                 `.issues` array. Count = array length. A crash yields
#                 unparseable output, not an empty array.
#   * dialyzer -> the "Total errors: N, Skipped: M" summary line. Count =
#                 N - M, which equals the findings actually emitted after the
#                 ignore file (verified: 127-5=122, 111-5=106, 113-16=97).
#                 Absence of the line means the run did not finish.
#
# Runtime: credo takes ~60 min repo-wide. `mix credo <path>` analyzes nothing
# against the root .credo.exs (verified: exit 0, zero findings, for `lib`,
# `lib/` and `packages/raxol_core/lib/`), so the scan cannot be sharded by
# path and must run as one pass. Run it nightly, not per-PR. Per-PR sharding
# needs a `.credo.exs` inside each package so `cd packages/<pkg> && mix credo`
# uses that package's own config; only raxol_agent_client_protocol has one.

# dialyxir keys its deps PLT off the DEPS HASH, which a path dependency does
# not move: editing or adding a module under packages/ leaves the PLT
# describing the old code, and dialyzer then reports against stale types. That
# produced two false readings -- a fix removing 16 callback_type_mismatch
# errors read as a no-op across two full runs, and a newly added raxol_core
# module was reported as "unknown_function ... does not exist".
#
# An earlier revision detected this by comparing mtimes. That is wrong in CI:
# actions/checkout writes every source file with mtime=now while actions/cache
# restores the PLT with its archived (older) mtime, so the check fired on
# EVERY warm-cache run and turned a blocking gate into an unconditional
# failure. Content hashing is order- and clock-independent, so it behaves the
# same locally and in CI.
#
# On mismatch we DISCARD the deps PLT and let the analysis run rebuild it. We
# deliberately do NOT call `mix dialyzer --plt` ourselves: doing so produced a
# deps PLT byte-for-byte the size of core.plt (1.98 MB vs the 11.8 MB of a
# populated one), and dialyxir then reported "PLT is up to date!" forever
# after because it keys freshness off a 20-byte `.plt.hash`. Analysing against
# that PLT yielded 2055 findings, 1845 of them `unknown_function` -- a
# fabricated regression from a broken cache, not from the code.
