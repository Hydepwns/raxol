## What's Been Completed

I've implemented several key components:

1. **Accessibility Module**:

   - Screen reader announcements system
   - High contrast mode
   - Reduced motion support
   - Large text accessibility
   - Component metadata for screen readers

2. **Theme Integration**:

   - Connected accessibility settings with visual components
   - High contrast color schemes
   - Dynamic style adaptation based on accessibility settings

3. **Focus Management & Navigation**:

   - Keyboard navigation system
   - Focus ring with customizable styles and animations
   - Tab order management
   - Focus announcement for screen readers

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:

   - Global and context-specific shortcuts
   - Priority-based shortcut handling
   - Shortcut help display
   - Integration with accessibility features

5. **Hint System**:

   - Multi-level hints (basic, detailed, examples)
   - Shortcut highlighting in hints
   - Context-sensitive help

6. **Documentation & Examples**:
   - README.md with feature overview
   - Accessibility Guide
   - Integration Examples
   - Demo applications for accessibility and keyboard shortcuts
   - Comprehensive test coverage

## What I Need Help With Next

I'd like you to focus on the following areas:

1. **Color System Integration**:

   - Implement a comprehensive color system that integrates with our accessibility features
   - Build on the ThemeIntegration module to support custom themes
   - Ensure all colors have accessible alternatives for high contrast mode
   - Create a color palette management system that respects user preferences

2. **Animation System Enhancements**:

   - Expand the animation capabilities in the FocusRing component
   - Build a general-purpose animation framework that respects reduced motion settings
   - Implement smooth transitions between UI states
   - Create standardized animation patterns for common interactions

3. **User Preferences System**:

   - Create a persistent storage system for user accessibility preferences
   - Implement preference management APIs
   - Add preference UI components
   - Ensure preferences are applied consistently across components

4. **Internationalization Framework**:

   - Lay groundwork for i18n support
   - Integrate with accessibility features
   - Support right-to-left languages
   - Handle screen reader announcements in multiple languages

5. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Create specialized test helpers for accessibility testing
   - Implement automated tests for WCAG compliance where applicable
   - Add performance testing for animation and rendering

## Codebase Information

- The core UX framework is in `lib/raxol/core/`
- Components are in `lib/raxol/components/`
- Examples are in `lib/raxol/examples/`
- Tests are in `test/raxol/`
- Documentation is in `docs/`

The most important modules to understand:

- `Raxol.Core.UXRefinement`: Central module that ties everything together
- `Raxol.Core.Accessibility`: Core accessibility features
- `Raxol.Core.Accessibility.ThemeIntegration`: Connects accessibility with themes
- `Raxol.Core.KeyboardShortcuts`: Manages keyboard shortcuts
- `Raxol.Core.FocusManager`: Handles focus state and navigation

## Development Approach

I've been focusing on:

- Comprehensive documentation
- Thorough test coverage
- Modular, extensible design
- Consistent API patterns
- Accessibility as a core feature, not an afterthought

Please maintain this approach as you continue development. All new features should be well-documented, thoroughly tested, and accessible by default.

Thank you for taking over this project! I'm excited to see how you enhance these UX refinement features.

# Handoff: Raxol Runtime Implementation & Rendering Pipeline

**Context:**

Continuing the effort to implement the core Raxol runtime based on the Application/TEA pattern and fix the rendering pipeline. Previous work involved refactoring `lib/raxol/terminal/configuration.ex` and reducing compiler warnings.

**Progress Made:**

1. **Runtime Logic Implementation:**

   - Implemented basic plugin loading in `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Plugins.Loader`.
   - Removed unused `Registry`.
   - Implemented `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Plugins.CommandRegistry` using ETS.
   - Implemented core `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Plugins.Manager` logic (placeholder discovery, loading, event filtering via `handle_call`, command registration).
   - Implemented `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Events.Dispatcher` (GenServer managing application state/model, event routing, command execution via `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Command`, PubSub via `Registry`, `handle_cast` for event dispatch).
   - Implemented `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Application` behaviour delegation.
   - Reviewed `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Debug` (simple Logger wrapper).
   - Created `Raxol.Runtime` module skeleton to orchestrate runtime components.
   - Created `Raxol.Terminal.Driver` module skeleton (GenServer, raw mode setup via `stty`, basic IO subscription).
   - **Completed basic input parsing (chars, arrows, Ctrl+C) and resize handling (`SIGWINCH`) in `Raxol.Terminal.Driver`.**
   - **Completed `Raxol.Runtime.main_loop` including event routing, resize handling, and quit signal processing.**
   - **Refactored `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Rendering.Engine` to fetch model from `Dispatcher` before rendering.**
   - **Added `Raxol.Runtime.Supervisor` to manage core processes.**

2. **Rendering Pipeline Fixes:**
   - Created `Raxol.UI.Renderer` module with basic `render_to_cells` implementation (handles `:text`, `:box` primitives).
   - Located `Raxol.UI.Theming.Theme` and using `Theme.get(:default)` as a placeholder for `Theme.current()`.
   - Refactored `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Rendering.Engine`:
     - Uses `Raxol.UI.Layout.Engine` for layout calculation.
     - Uses `Raxol.UI.Renderer` to convert positioned elements to cells.
     - Uses `IO.write` for basic terminal output.
     - Removed `@doc` from private functions.
   - Integrated components (`Manager`, `Dispatcher`, `Driver`, `RenderingEngine`) into `Raxol.Runtime` startup sequence.
   - Established basic event/render flow: `Driver` -> `Dispatcher` -> `Runtime` -> `RenderingEngine`.

**Remaining Warning Categories (Summary):**

Compiler warnings should be significantly reduced. A `mix compile --force | cat` should be run to verify. Potential remaining warnings might be related to unimplemented parts or `TODO`s.

**Implementation TODOs:**

- **Terminal Driver:** Implement full input parsing (ANSI sequences for keys, mouse, etc.) in `Raxol.Terminal.Driver.parse_and_dispatch_input`. Handle terminal resize events (e.g., `SIGWINCH`). Query initial terminal size and send event.
- **UI Renderer:** Implement rendering for other layout primitives/components (borders, tables, etc.) in `Raxol.UI.Renderer`. Apply theme styles correctly.
- **Theme System:** Implement `Theme.current()` or equivalent mechanism for selecting/managing the active theme.
- **Runtime Loop:** Complete the `Raxol.Runtime.main_loop` logic (state updates, error handling, quit signal processing). Implement reliable cleanup/terminal restoration.
- **Rendering Engine:** Refine `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Rendering.Engine` state management. Ensure it correctly fetches the latest application model from the `Dispatcher` via `handle_call(:get_model, ...)` when rendering.
- **Command Execution:** Ensure command results (`{:command_result, msg}`) are correctly handled in `Dispatcher.handle_info` and fed back into `Application.update`.
- **Plugin System:** Implement actual plugin discovery, dependency sorting, and reloading in `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Plugins.Manager`.
- **Supervision:** Introduce a proper supervision tree for runtime processes in `Raxol.Runtime` or a dedicated `Raxol.Application`.

**Instructions for Next Agent:**

**Status:** Basic runtime loop, input processing (**DONE**), rendering flow functional under supervision. Basic tests added. All applicable examples refactored. Successfully resolved a series of cascading compilation errors. The project now compiles cleanly (with warnings). **Added basic mouse event parsing tests (VT200, SGR) to `TerminalDriverTest`. Expanded `RuntimeTest` to verify supervisor restarts and the basic event->update flow in `Dispatcher`. Rendering pipeline theme integration is complete.**

**Next Steps:**

1.  ~~**Write Tests:** Add more detailed tests for the `TerminalDriver` input parsing and the `Runtime` loop/process interaction...~~ (**DONE for basic mouse events, supervisor behavior, and interaction flow.** Further detailed testing, especially involving mocking for render verification, can be done later.)
2.  ~~**Implement Full Input Parsing:** Complete the input parsing logic in `TerminalDriver.parse_and_dispatch_input` to handle a wider range of ANSI sequences (e.g., more function keys, modifiers like Alt/Shift, focus events, potentially bracketed paste). Refer to terminal documentation (like XTerm, VT100/VT220) for sequences.~~ (**DONE:** Added missing parsing logic for tested keys/mouse. Added parsing and tests for Alt, Shift+Arrows, Focus, Bracketed Paste.)
3.  **Refine Rendering Pipeline:** (**DONE** - Theme integration; **TODO** - Border drawing, `Terminal.Renderer` review)
    - Implement rendering for _borders_ in `Raxol.UI.Renderer.render_box` based on theme styles.
    - ~~Integrate theme application (`Theme.current()`) properly into the `RenderingEngine` or `Renderer`.~~ (**DONE** via Dispatcher state)
    - (Optional) Review `Raxol.Terminal.Renderer` to ensure optimal ANSI generation for themed cells.
4.  **Implement Command Execution Flow:** Ensure commands returned by `Application.update` (like the `:quit` example) are correctly routed (`Dispatcher` -> `Runtime`) and handled. Implement handling for other potential core commands (e.g., clipboard, notifications if plugins exist).
5.  **Plugin System Implementation:** ~~Flesh out plugin discovery, loading, dependency management, and event handling in `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Plugins.Manager`.~~ (**DONE** - Basic discovery, loading, `Plugin` behaviour, command registration; **TODO** - Dependency sorting, reloading, event filtering, command delegation, shutdown)
6.  **Address Compiler Warnings:** ~~Run `mix compile --force --warnings-as-errors` (or similar) and systematically fix the remaining warnings.~~ (**PARTIAL:** Fixed several warnings/errors related to syntax, unused variables/aliases, undefined functions, unreachable clauses. **BLOCKED** by cyclic dependency causing `Event` struct expansion error in `Dispatcher`. Requires manual review. Remaining warnings: private `@doc` in `Engine`, ungrouped clauses in `LayoutEngine` - edits failed).
7.  **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** with progress from steps 3-6.
8.  **Update this handoff prompt** accordingly.
