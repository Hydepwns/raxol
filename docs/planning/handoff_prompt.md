# Development Handoff: Raxol UX Refinement & Accessibility

I've been working on enhancing the Raxol framework with comprehensive UX refinement and accessibility features. Here's what I've accomplished so far and what I'd like you to help me with next.

## What's Been Completed

I've implemented several key components:

1. **Accessibility Module**:

   - Screen reader announcements system
   - High contrast mode
   - Reduced motion support
   - Large text accessibility
   - Component metadata for screen readers

2. **Theme Integration**:

   - Connected accessibility settings with visual components
   - High contrast color schemes
   - Dynamic style adaptation based on accessibility settings

3. **Focus Management & Navigation**:

   - Keyboard navigation system
   - Focus ring with customizable styles and animations
   - Tab order management
   - Focus announcement for screen readers

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:

   - Global and context-specific shortcuts
   - Priority-based shortcut handling
   - Shortcut help display
   - Integration with accessibility features

5. **Hint System**:

   - Multi-level hints (basic, detailed, examples)
   - Shortcut highlighting in hints
   - Context-sensitive help

6. **Documentation & Examples**:
   - README.md with feature overview
   - Accessibility Guide
   - Integration Examples
   - Demo applications for accessibility and keyboard shortcuts
   - Comprehensive test coverage

## What I Need Help With Next

I'd like you to focus on the following areas:

1. **Color System Integration**:

   - Implement a comprehensive color system that integrates with our accessibility features
   - Build on the ThemeIntegration module to support custom themes
   - Ensure all colors have accessible alternatives for high contrast mode
   - Create a color palette management system that respects user preferences

2. **Animation System Enhancements**:

   - Expand the animation capabilities in the FocusRing component
   - Build a general-purpose animation framework that respects reduced motion settings
   - Implement smooth transitions between UI states
   - Create standardized animation patterns for common interactions

3. **User Preferences System**:

   - Create a persistent storage system for user accessibility preferences
   - Implement preference management APIs
   - Add preference UI components
   - Ensure preferences are applied consistently across components

4. **Internationalization Framework**:

   - Lay groundwork for i18n support
   - Integrate with accessibility features
   - Support right-to-left languages
   - Handle screen reader announcements in multiple languages

5. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Create specialized test helpers for accessibility testing
   - Implement automated tests for WCAG compliance where applicable
   - Add performance testing for animation and rendering

## Codebase Information

- The core UX framework is in `lib/raxol/core/`
- Components are in `lib/raxol/components/`
- Examples are in `lib/raxol/examples/`
- Tests are in `test/raxol/`
- Documentation is in `docs/`

The most important modules to understand:

- `Raxol.Core.UXRefinement`: Central module that ties everything together
- `Raxol.Core.Accessibility`: Core accessibility features
- `Raxol.Core.Accessibility.ThemeIntegration`: Connects accessibility with themes
- `Raxol.Core.KeyboardShortcuts`: Manages keyboard shortcuts
- `Raxol.Core.FocusManager`: Handles focus state and navigation

## Development Approach

I've been focusing on:

- Comprehensive documentation
- Thorough test coverage
- Modular, extensible design
- Consistent API patterns
- Accessibility as a core feature, not an afterthought

Please maintain this approach as you continue development. All new features should be well-documented, thoroughly tested, and accessible by default.

Thank you for taking over this project! I'm excited to see how you enhance these UX refinement features.

# Handoff: Raxol Warning Cleanup & Refactoring

**Context:**

Continuing the effort to clean up compilation warnings and refactor large files according to `docs/archive/REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md`. The file `lib/raxol/terminal/configuration.ex` has been successfully refactored. Progress has been made on reducing compiler warnings by fixing unused code, incorrect calls, typing violations, and creating necessary placeholder modules/functions. All outstanding changes were organized into logical commits.

**Current Goal:**

Implement core runtime components, fix the rendering pipeline, and address remaining minor compiler warnings.

**Remaining Warning Categories (Summary):**

Most compilation warnings were addressed through fixes or placeholder implementations. The main remaining warnings (consult `mix compile --force | cat`) are:

- **Engine Warnings:** In `lib/raxol/core/runtime/rendering/engine.ex`:
  - **Private Function Doc:** Persistent warning for `@doc` on private `render_to_terminal/1`.
  - **Unused Alias:** `Renderer` alias is currently unused due to commented-out code.
- **Implementation TODOs:** The core logic for placeholder modules/functions created during refactoring still needs implementation (e.g., `Loader.load_plugin`, `process_view` in `engine.ex`, `Application` behaviour callbacks, `Dispatcher` logic, `Plugin Manager` state transitions).

**Instructions for Next Agent:**

1. **Implement Runtime Logic:** Focus on implementing the core logic for the placeholder modules created in `lib/raxol/core/runtime/` and `lib/raxol/core/runtime/plugins/` (`Application`, `Debug`, `Loader`, `Registry`, `CommandRegistry`, `Dispatcher`, `Manager`). Replace placeholder return values (like in `Loader.load_plugin`) with actual implementations.
2. **Fix Rendering Pipeline:**
   - Re-enable the `process_view` function in `lib/raxol/core/runtime/rendering/engine.ex`.
   - Determine the correct mechanism for converting the application view into renderable cells (the previous `Element.to_cells` call is likely incorrect or incomplete). This might involve implementing logic in `Raxol.UI.Layout.Engine`, `Raxol.Core.Renderer.Element`, or a dedicated `Raxol.UI.Renderer` module.
   - Implement or locate the mechanism for getting the current theme (e.g., `Theme.current()`).
3. **Address Remaining Warnings:** Once the rendering pipeline is functional, fix the remaining warnings in `engine.ex` (unused alias, potentially others revealed by uncommenting code). Investigate the persistent `@doc` warning if time permits (low priority).
4. **Write Tests:** Add tests for the implemented runtime and rendering functionality, following existing patterns.
5. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** with significant changes made.
6. **Update this handoff prompt** with the next target once runtime components and rendering are functional or a new priority emerges.
