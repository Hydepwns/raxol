# Packages

Raxol ships as a main package plus 17 focused subsystems. Use the main `raxol` package for the full framework, or take individual packages for narrower needs.

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |

| `raxol_earn` (pre-alpha)                                    | `path: "packages/raxol_earn"`  | Virtuals Agent Commerce Protocol (seller)   |
| `raxol_agent_client_protocol` (pre-alpha)                  | `path: "packages/raxol_agent_client_protocol"` | Editor<->agent Agent Client Protocol (agentclientprotocol.com) |
| `raxol_symphony` (pre-alpha)                        | `path: "packages/raxol_symphony"` | Tracker-driven coding-agent orchestrator |
| `raxol_gateway` (pre-alpha)                                | `path: "packages/raxol_gateway"`  | Unified messaging gateway (multi-platform) |
| `raxol_cli` (pre-alpha)                                    | `path: "packages/raxol_cli"`      | The `raxol` command (`code`, `p`, `acp`, `agent`, `playground`, `new`), packaged as a self-contained Burrito binary |
| `raxol_console` (pre-alpha)                                | `path: "packages/raxol_console"`  | Boots a Virtuals ACP Console agent package onto the gateway stack |

The **coding agent** layers as: `Backend.Selector` (LLM backend adapter) -> the **Harness** engine (the event/command contract `Raxol.Agent.Contract` and the durable journal `Raxol.Agent.Journal` in `raxol_agent`, the projections and surface widgets `Raxol.Harness.*` in main `raxol`) -> the product surfaces `mix raxol.code` (interactive TUI, also over SSH), `mix raxol.p` (headless one-shot), and `mix raxol.acp` (ACP on stdio, for editors), all three in `raxol_agent` -> `raxol_symphony`, which orchestrates many agent runs above them. The Harness is the engine; the `mix raxol.harness.*.bless` tasks only regenerate its golden/fixture test snapshots.

## Dependency graph

```
raxol --> raxol_core, raxol_terminal, raxol_sensor, raxol_mcp,
          raxol_liveview, raxol_plugin

raxol_terminal --> raxol_core
raxol_mcp      --> raxol_core
raxol_liveview --> raxol_core (+ phoenix_live_view optional)
raxol_plugin   --> raxol_core

raxol_agent    --> raxol + raxol_mcp
raxol_payments --> raxol_agent (compile-time only)
raxol_earn      --> raxol_payments (runtime), raxol_mcp + raxol_agent (compile-time only)
raxol_agent_client_protocol --> (none; jason only, zero raxol deps)
raxol_symphony --> raxol_core, raxol_agent, raxol_mcp (all optional)
raxol_cli      --> raxol, raxol_agent (+ raxol_agent_client_protocol for `raxol acp`)
raxol_console  --> raxol_agent, raxol_gateway, raxol_earn

raxol_speech   --> raxol_core (+ bumblebee/nx/exla optional for STT)
raxol_telegram --> raxol_core (+ raxol/telegex/raxol_gateway optional)
raxol_watch    --> raxol_core (+ pigeon optional for APNS/FCM)
raxol_gateway  --> raxol_core (+ raxol_agent optional)

raxol_core     --> telemetry (only external dep)
raxol_sensor   --> (none)
```

The main `raxol` package does not depend on `raxol_agent`, `raxol_earn`, `raxol_agent_client_protocol`, `raxol_gateway`, or any of the surface packages. You opt into those.

## Publishing

See [Hex Publishing](https://github.com/DROOdotFOO/raxol/blob/master/CLAUDE.md#hex-publishing) for the publish order. `HEX_BUILD=1` strips local path deps so `mix hex.build` sees only Hex packages.

Run `mix raxol.release.check` before publishing anything. It walks the public train in dependency order and, per package, validates the metadata, confirms every file the tarball would carry is tracked by git, and runs `mix hex.build --unpack` without publishing. `--metadata-only` skips the builds; `mix raxol.check` runs that faster half for you.

Two failures are worth recognising on sight:

- `packaged file X is not tracked by git`: `mix hex.build` packages the working tree, not the commit, so an untracked file under a packaged directory really would ship. Dotfiles count: `.env`, `.env.*` and `.secrets` are gitignored, which makes them untracked by construction and exactly what this catches. Commit it, ignore it via `:exclude_patterns`, or narrow the `:files` entry. `--allow-untracked` downgrades this to a warning, which is what `mix raxol.check` passes so an unstaged new module does not fail the interactive gate; CI runs without it.
- `release dependency X is dropped from the published tarball`: a `HEX_BUILD` conditional in that package's `mix.exs` removed a dependency. Intended for pre-alpha packages that are not on the train yet, and reported as a warning so the choice stays visible rather than silent.
