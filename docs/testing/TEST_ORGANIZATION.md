# Test Organization Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the test organization strategy used in the Raxol project, including logical commit organization, test structure, and best practices for maintaining a clean and reliable test suite.

## Logical Commit Organization

### Commit Structure Principles

When organizing changes into commits, follow these principles:

1. **Group by Subsystem**: Organize changes by major system components
2. **Include Related Tests**: Always include tests with their corresponding implementation changes
3. **Logical Dependencies**: Ensure commits build upon each other logically
4. **Clear Commit Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages that explain the scope and purpose

### Typical Commit Organization

```bash
# 1. Terminal System Changes
git commit -m "terminal: major enhancements, refactoring, and bug fixes across buffer, ANSI, plugin, and rendering subsystems. Includes improved test coverage."

# 2. Core System Changes
git commit -m "core: improve metrics, performance, and UX refinement. Refactor aggregator, visualizer, and related tests."

# 3. UI Component Changes
git commit -m "ui: update base components, input fields, progress spinner, and layout engine. Improve related tests."

# 4. Test Infrastructure Changes
git commit -m "test: update and expand test suite, fixtures, and support scripts for improved coverage and reliability."

# 5. Configuration and Application Changes
git commit -m "config, app, plugins: update configuration, application startup, plugin events, renderer, and metrics collector. Minor script improvements."

# 6. Documentation and Cleanup
git commit -m "docs, fixtures: add compilation error plan, critical fixes reference, and plugin test backups. Clean up tmp files."
```

## Test Directory Structure

```bash
test/
├── core/                    # Core system tests
│   ├── buffer/             # Buffer-related tests
│   ├── performance/        # Performance tests
│   └── renderer/           # Renderer tests
├── raxol/                  # Main application tests
│   ├── terminal/           # Terminal subsystem tests
│   │   ├── ansi/           # ANSI processing tests
│   │   ├── buffer/         # Buffer management tests
│   │   ├── commands/       # Command handling tests
│   │   └── ...             # Other terminal components
│   ├── core/               # Core functionality tests
│   ├── ui/                 # UI component tests
│   └── plugins/            # Plugin system tests
├── fixtures/               # Test fixtures and data
│   ├── plugins/            # Plugin test fixtures
│   ├── scripts/            # Script test fixtures
│   └── themes/             # Theme test fixtures
├── support/                # Test support utilities
│   ├── mocks/              # Mock implementations
│   └── helpers/            # Test helper functions
└── js/                     # JavaScript/frontend tests
```

## Test Organization Best Practices

### 1. Test File Naming

- Use descriptive names that indicate the component being tested
- Follow the pattern: `{component}_test.exs`
- Group related tests in subdirectories

### 2. Test Structure

```elixir
defmodule Raxol.Component.Test do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  # Module aliases
  alias Raxol.Component

  # Setup and helpers
  setup do
    # Test setup
  end

  # Test groups
  describe "feature_name" do
    test "specific behavior" do
      # Test implementation
    end
  end
end
```

### 3. Test Data Management

- Use fixtures for complex test data
- Create helper functions for common test scenarios
- Keep test data close to the tests that use it

### 4. Mock Usage

- Use mocks sparingly and only when necessary
- Prefer real implementations over mocks when possible
- Document mock behavior clearly

## Test Reliability Guidelines

### 1. Avoid Flaky Tests

- Don't use `Process.sleep` for synchronization
- Use event-based synchronization instead
- Ensure proper test cleanup

### 2. Test Isolation

- Each test should be independent
- Clean up resources after each test
- Don't rely on test execution order

### 3. Error Handling

- Test both success and failure cases
- Verify error messages and types
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

## Performance Testing

### 1. Performance Benchmarks

- Use `Raxol.Test.PerformanceHelper` for performance tests
- Set strict performance requirements
- Monitor performance regressions

### 2. Benchmark Categories

- Event processing benchmarks
- Screen update benchmarks
- Concurrent operation benchmarks
- Memory usage benchmarks

## Test Maintenance

### 1. Regular Review

- Review test failures regularly
- Update tests when APIs change
- Remove obsolete tests

### 2. Documentation

- Document complex test scenarios
- Explain test data and fixtures
- Keep test documentation up to date

### 3. Continuous Improvement

- Refactor tests for better organization
- Improve test coverage where needed
- Optimize test performance

## Common Patterns

### 1. Testing Terminal Commands

```elixir
test "handles command with parameters" do
  emulator = Emulator.new()
  result = CommandHandler.handle(emulator, [param1, param2])

  assert result.some_field == expected_value
  assert result.other_field == other_expected_value
end
```

### 2. Testing UI Components

```elixir
test "renders component correctly" do
  component = Component.new(attrs)
  rendered = Component.render(component)

  assert rendered.content == expected_content
  assert rendered.style == expected_style
end
```

### 3. Testing Plugin System

```elixir
test "loads plugin with dependencies" do
  plugin = TestPlugin.new()
  result = PluginManager.load(plugin)

  assert {:ok, loaded_plugin} = result
  assert loaded_plugin.dependencies == expected_deps
end
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Failures**: Check for timing issues and use proper synchronization
2. **Mock Problems**: Ensure mocks are properly set up and torn down
3. **Resource Leaks**: Verify proper cleanup in test teardown
4. **Performance Issues**: Use performance benchmarks to identify bottlenecks

### Debugging Tips

- Use `IO.inspect` for debugging (remove before committing)
- Check test logs for detailed error information
- Use `mix test --trace` for detailed test execution
- Review test fixtures and mock implementations

## Conclusion

Following this test organization guide helps maintain a clean, reliable, and maintainable test suite. Regular review and improvement of test organization ensures that the test suite continues to provide value as the project evolves.
