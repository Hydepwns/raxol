# Performance Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the performance testing standards and practices for the Raxol project. It includes performance targets, testing methodologies, and best practices for writing and maintaining performance tests.

## Performance Targets

### 1. Event Processing

- **Average:** < 1ms
- **95th Percentile:** < 2ms
- **99th Percentile:** < 5ms
- **Maximum:** < 10ms

### 2. Screen Updates

- **Average:** < 2ms
- **95th Percentile:** < 5ms
- **99th Percentile:** < 10ms
- **Maximum:** < 20ms

### 3. Concurrent Operations

- **Average:** < 5ms
- **95th Percentile:** < 10ms
- **99th Percentile:** < 20ms
- **Maximum:** < 50ms

## Test Structure

### 1. Basic Performance Test

```elixir
defmodule Raxol.Performance.FeatureTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true
  import Raxol.Test.PerformanceHelper

  test "meets performance targets" do
    {time, _} = measure_time(fn ->
      # Code to measure
    end)

    assert_operation_performance(fn ->
      # Code to measure
    end, "operation name", 1.0)
  end
end
```

### 2. Load Test

```elixir
test "handles concurrent load" do
  operations = [
    fn -> # Operation 1
    end,
    fn -> # Operation 2
    end
  ]

  assert_concurrent_performance(operations, "concurrent operations", 5.0)
end
```

### 3. Stress Test

```elixir
test "handles stress conditions" do
  {time, _} = measure_time(fn ->
    # Operation to measure
  end)

  assert_operation_performance(fn ->
    # Operation to measure
  end, "stress test", 10.0)
end
```

## Performance Helpers

### 1. Measurement Helpers

```elixir
defmodule Raxol.Test.PerformanceHelper do
  def measure_time(operation) do
    # Measure execution time
    # Returns {time_in_ms, result}
  end

  def measure_average_time(operation, iterations \\ 1000) do
    # Measure average execution time
    # Returns average time in milliseconds
  end

  def measure_memory(operation) do
    # Measure memory usage
    # Returns {memory_in_bytes, result}
  end
end
```

### 2. Assertion Helpers

```elixir
defmodule Raxol.Test.PerformanceHelper do
  def assert_operation_performance(operation, name, threshold \\ 0.001, iterations \\ 1000) do
    # Assert operation meets performance threshold
  end

  def assert_concurrent_performance(operations, name, threshold \\ 0.002, iterations \\ 1000) do
    # Assert concurrent operations meet performance threshold
  end

  def assert_memory_usage(operation, name, threshold \\ 1_000_000) do
    # Assert operation meets memory usage threshold
  end
end
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Performance Tests

- Measure individual function performance
- Focus on specific operations
- Use controlled test environment
- Compare against baseline

### 2. Integration Performance Tests

- Measure component interaction performance
- Test real-world scenarios
- Include system dependencies
- Monitor resource usage

### 3. System Performance Tests

- Measure end-to-end performance
- Test under production-like conditions
- Include all system components
- Monitor system resources

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Environment

- Use consistent hardware
- Control system load
- Monitor resource usage
- Document environment details

### 2. Test Data

- Use realistic data sizes
- Include edge cases
- Document data characteristics
- Maintain test data sets

### 3. Measurement

- Use high-precision timing
- Account for system noise
- Run multiple iterations
- Calculate statistical significance

### 4. Reporting

- Document test conditions
- Include performance metrics
- Compare against targets
- Track historical data

## Common Patterns

### 1. Baseline Comparison

```elixir
test "maintains performance baseline" do
  {time, _} = measure_time(fn ->
    # Code to measure
  end)

  assert_operation_performance(fn ->
    # Code to measure
  end, "baseline comparison", 1.0)
end
```

### 2. Resource Monitoring

```elixir
test "monitors resource usage" do
  {memory, _} = measure_memory(fn ->
    # Code to measure
  end)

  assert_memory_usage(fn ->
    # Code to measure
  end, "resource monitoring", 1_000_000)
end
```

### 3. Load Testing

```elixir
test "handles increasing load" do
  operations = for i <- 1..10 do
    fn ->
      # Operation with load i
    end
  end

  assert_concurrent_performance(operations, "load testing", 5.0)
end
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Common Issues

- System noise affecting measurements
- Resource contention
- Test isolation problems
- Measurement overhead

### 2. Debugging Tips

- Monitor system resources
- Check for background processes
- Verify test isolation
- Analyze measurement overhead
