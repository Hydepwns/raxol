# Performance Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the performance testing standards and practices for the Raxol project. It includes performance targets, testing methodologies, and best practices for writing and maintaining performance tests.

## Performance Targets

### 1. Event Processing

- **Average:** < 1ms
- **95th Percentile:** < 2ms
- **99th Percentile:** < 5ms
- **Maximum:** < 10ms

### 2. Screen Updates

- **Average:** < 2ms
- **95th Percentile:** < 5ms
- **99th Percentile:** < 10ms
- **Maximum:** < 20ms

### 3. Concurrent Operations

- **Average:** < 5ms
- **95th Percentile:** < 10ms
- **99th Percentile:** < 20ms
- **Maximum:** < 50ms

## Test Structure

### 1. Basic Performance Test

```elixir
defmodule Raxol.Performance.FeatureTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true
  import Raxol.Test.PerformanceHelpers

  test "meets performance targets" do
    measurements = measure_performance(fn ->
      # Code to measure
    end)

    assert_performance_targets(measurements, %{
      average: 1,
      p95: 2,
      p99: 5,
      max: 10
    })
  end
end
```

### 2. Load Test

```elixir
test "handles concurrent load" do
  measurements = measure_concurrent_performance(
    num_operations: 100,
    concurrency: 10,
    fn ->
      # Operation to measure
    end
  )

  assert_concurrent_performance_targets(measurements, %{
    average: 5,
    p95: 10,
    p99: 20,
    max: 50
  })
end
```

### 3. Stress Test

```elixir
test "handles stress conditions" do
  measurements = measure_stress_performance(
    duration: :timer.seconds(30),
    load: :high,
    fn ->
      # Operation to measure
    end
  )

  assert_stress_performance_targets(measurements, %{
    average: 10,
    p95: 20,
    p99: 50,
    max: 100
  })
end
```

## Performance Helpers

### 1. Measurement Helpers

```elixir
defmodule Raxol.Test.PerformanceHelpers do
  def measure_performance(fun) do
    # Measure execution time
    # Calculate statistics
    # Return measurements
  end

  def measure_concurrent_performance(opts, fun) do
    # Run concurrent operations
    # Measure execution time
    # Calculate statistics
    # Return measurements
  end

  def measure_stress_performance(opts, fun) do
    # Run stress test
    # Measure execution time
    # Calculate statistics
    # Return measurements
  end
end
```

### 2. Assertion Helpers

```elixir
defmodule Raxol.Test.PerformanceAssertions do
  def assert_performance_targets(measurements, targets) do
    assert measurements.average <= targets.average
    assert measurements.p95 <= targets.p95
    assert measurements.p99 <= targets.p99
    assert measurements.max <= targets.max
  end

  def assert_concurrent_performance_targets(measurements, targets) do
    assert_performance_targets(measurements, targets)
    assert measurements.throughput >= targets.throughput
  end

  def assert_stress_performance_targets(measurements, targets) do
    assert_performance_targets(measurements, targets)
    assert measurements.stability >= targets.stability
  end
end
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Performance Tests

- Measure individual function performance
- Focus on specific operations
- Use controlled test environment
- Compare against baseline

### 2. Integration Performance Tests

- Measure component interaction performance
- Test real-world scenarios
- Include system dependencies
- Monitor resource usage

### 3. System Performance Tests

- Measure end-to-end performance
- Test under production-like conditions
- Include all system components
- Monitor system resources

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Environment

- Use consistent hardware
- Control system load
- Monitor resource usage
- Document environment details

### 2. Test Data

- Use realistic data sizes
- Include edge cases
- Document data characteristics
- Maintain test data sets

### 3. Measurement

- Use high-precision timing
- Account for system noise
- Run multiple iterations
- Calculate statistical significance

### 4. Reporting

- Document test conditions
- Include performance metrics
- Compare against targets
- Track historical data

## Common Patterns

### 1. Baseline Comparison

```elixir
test "maintains performance baseline" do
  baseline = load_baseline_measurements()
  current = measure_performance(fn ->
    # Code to measure
  end)

  assert_performance_regression(current, baseline)
end
```

### 2. Resource Monitoring

```elixir
test "monitors resource usage" do
  measurements = measure_with_resources(fn ->
    # Code to measure
  end)

  assert_resource_usage(measurements, %{
    cpu: 50,    # percent
    memory: 100 # MB
  })
end
```

### 3. Load Testing

```elixir
test "handles increasing load" do
  measurements = measure_load_scaling(
    start_load: 10,
    end_load: 100,
    step: 10,
    fn load ->
      # Operation to measure
    end
  )

  assert_load_scaling(measurements, %{
    linear: true,
    max_degradation: 20 # percent
  })
end
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Common Issues

- System noise affecting measurements
- Resource contention
- Test isolation problems
- Measurement overhead

### 2. Debugging Tips

- Monitor system resources
- Check for background processes
- Verify test isolation
- Analyze measurement overhead
