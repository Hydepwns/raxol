- **Priority:** High

#### Test: `test/raxol/core/runtime/plugins/command_registry_test.exs`

- **Test:** "handles complex command chaining"
- **Reason:** Command chaining implementation pending
- **Blocked by:** Command execution pipeline improvements
- **Priority:** Medium

### 2. FileWatcher (5 skipped)

#### Test: `test/raxol/core/runtime/file_watcher_test.exs`

- **Test:** "handles recursive directory watching"
- **Reason:** Recursive watching implementation incomplete
- **Blocked by:** Directory traversal optimization
- **Priority:** High

### 3. SelectList (4 skipped)

#### Test: `test/raxol/components/select_list_test.exs`

- **Test:** "handles custom item rendering"
- **Reason:** Custom renderer API pending
- **Blocked by:** Component system improvements
- **Priority:** Medium

### 4. Integration Tests (4 skipped)

#### Test: `test/integration/plugin_lifecycle_test.exs`

- **Reason:** Hot reload implementation incomplete
- **Blocked by:** Plugin system improvements
- **Priority:** High

## Performance Test Failures

### 1. Host Component ID Issues

- **Location:** `test/performance/host_component_test.exs`
- **Issue:** Undefined host_component_id in performance tests
- **Impact:** Blocks performance benchmarking
- **Priority:** High

### 2. Event Processing

- **Location:** `test/performance/event_processing_test.exs`
- **Issue:** Event processing benchmarks not meeting targets
- **Target:** < 1ms average, < 2ms 95th percentile
- **Priority:** High

### 3. Concurrent Operations

- **Location:** `test/performance/concurrent_operations_test.exs`
- **Issue:** Concurrent operation benchmarks not meeting targets
- **Target:** < 5ms average, < 10ms 95th percentile
- **Priority:** Medium

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Test Stabilization (Week 1-2)

1. Address plugin system test failures
2. Fix FileWatcher related failures
3. Complete SelectList implementation
4. Document remaining skipped tests

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Week 3-4)
