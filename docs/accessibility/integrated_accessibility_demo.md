# Integrated Accessibility Demo

This document explains how to run and interact with the Raxol integrated accessibility demo, which showcases how the various accessibility features work together across different systems.

## Overview

The integrated accessibility demo provides an interactive way to explore Raxol's accessibility features working cohesively with:

- Color system with high contrast mode and theme switching
- Animation framework with reduced motion support
- Internationalization with RTL language support
- User preferences with persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts and focus management

## Running the Demo

To run the demo, you can use the following command in your Elixir project:

```elixir
Raxol.Examples.IntegratedAccessibilityDemo.run()
```

This will launch an interactive terminal interface that allows you to explore the various accessibility features of the Raxol framework.

## Demo Sections

The demo is organized into the following sections:

1. **Welcome**: Provides an overview of the demo and current settings
2. **Color System**: Demonstrates theme switching and high contrast mode
3. **Animation**: Shows how animations adapt to reduced motion settings
4. **Internationalization**: Demonstrates language switching and RTL support
5. **User Preferences**: Shows how preferences are saved and persisted
6. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Displays available keyboard shortcuts

## Controls

### Navigation

- **Up/Down Arrow Keys**: Move focus between sections
- **Enter**: Select the focused section
- **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Adjust settings within a section
- **Tab**: Toggle reduced motion mode
- **Space**: Perform the primary action in the current section

### Shortcut Keys

- **Alt+H**: Toggle high contrast mode
- **Alt+M**: Toggle reduced motion mode
- **Alt+T**: Switch to the next theme
- **Alt+L**: Switch to the next language
- **Alt+S**: Save user preferences
- **Ctrl+Q**: Exit the demo

## Exploring Accessibility Features

### Color System

In the Color System section, you can:

- Switch between different themes (standard, dark, high contrast)
- Toggle high contrast mode on/off
- See how colors adapt to ensure sufficient contrast
- View color swatches of the current theme colors

### Animation

In the Animation section, you can:

- Toggle reduced motion mode
- Start/stop a sample animation
- Adjust animation speed
- Observe how animations adapt to reduced motion settings
- Notice screen reader announcements for important animations

### Internationalization

In the Internationalization section, you can:

- Switch between available languages
- See translations of key UI elements
- Experience RTL text rendering for Arabic
- Notice how screen reader announcements are properly translated

### User Preferences

In the User Preferences section, you can:

- View your current preference settings
- Save preferences to make them persistent
- Reset preferences to defaults

## Accessibility Features in Action

### Screen Reader Integration

Throughout the demo, important actions trigger screen reader announcements in the user's preferred language. For example:

- Changing themes announces the new theme
- Toggling high contrast mode announces the new state
- Completing animations announces completion
- Changing languages announces the new language

### High Contrast Mode

When high contrast mode is enabled:

- All theme colors automatically adjust for higher contrast
- Focus indicators become more prominent
- Text colors adjust to maintain WCAG compliance

### Reduced Motion

When reduced motion mode is enabled:

- Animations are significantly shortened or disabled
- Progress indicators use simpler animations
- Visual effects are toned down

### RTL Support

When using Arabic or other RTL languages:

- Text displays right-to-left
- UI layout adapts to RTL flow
- Navigation direction is reversed

## Best Practices Demonstrated

The demo showcases several accessibility best practices:

1. **Multiple ways to perform actions**: Both direct controls and keyboard shortcuts
2. **Clear focus indicators**: Current focus is always clearly visible
3. **Screen reader announcements**: Important state changes are announced
4. **Respecting user preferences**: Settings are applied consistently
5. **Internationalization**: Full support for multiple languages
6. **Reduced motion**: Animations adapt to user preferences
7. **High contrast**: Colors adjust for better visibility
8. **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility

## Implementation Details

The demo is implemented using several key modules:

- `Raxol.Core.Accessibility`: Core accessibility features
- `Raxol.Core.UserPreferences`: User preference management
- `Raxol.Core.I18n`: Internationalization system
- `Raxol.Style.Colors.System`: Color system
- `Raxol.Animation.Framework`: Animation framework
- `Raxol.UI.Terminal`: Terminal rendering utilities

For more details on how these systems work together, see:

- [Accessibility and Color System Integration](./accessibility_color_integration.md)
- [Internationalization and Accessibility Integration](./i18n_accessibility.md)

## Extending the Demo

To extend the demo with additional features:

1. Add new sections to the `@demo_sections` list in `IntegratedAccessibilityDemo`
2. Create corresponding render functions for each new section
3. Add appropriate key handlers for the new sections
4. Add additional translations for any new UI text

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal Compatibility

The demo uses ANSI escape sequences for colors and cursor positioning, which may not work in all terminals. For best results, use a modern terminal that supports 24-bit color and Unicode.

### Screen Reader Compatibility

To test screen reader announcements, you'll need to have a terminal screen reader configured. The demo uses a simulated screen reader for demonstration purposes.
