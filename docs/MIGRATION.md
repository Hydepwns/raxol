# Documentation Migration Guide

This document tracks the consolidation of Raxol's documentation structure during Phase 4.

## Changes Made

### Files Consolidated

1. **Main Documentation Entry Points**
   - `/README.md` → Simplified project overview (kept)
   - `/docs/README.md` → Merged into `/docs/CONSOLIDATED_README.md`
   - Content deduplicated and cross-references updated

2. **Component Documentation**
   - `/docs/components/README.md` → Primary component guide (kept)
   - `/examples/guides/03_components_and_layout/components/README.md` → User-focused guide (kept)
   - Clear distinction: technical reference vs. user guide

3. **Installation Instructions**
   - Previously duplicated across 3 files
   - Now centralized in `/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
   - Other files reference this single source

4. **Feature Lists**
   - Previously duplicated across 2 files
   - Now maintained only in main `/README.md`
   - Other locations reference main list

5. **Example Listings**
   - Previously duplicated between main README and examples
   - Now maintained only in `/examples/snippets/README.md`
   - Main README references the examples directory

### Content Moved

- Installation procedures → `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Feature descriptions → Main `README.md`
- Example catalogs → `examples/snippets/README.md`
- Development setup → `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`

### Files Removed

None yet - preserving all content during consolidation phase.

### Next Steps

After validation:
1. Update `/README.md` to reference consolidated docs
2. Update `/docs/README.md` to redirect to consolidated version
3. Remove duplicate content while preserving links
4. Standardize frontmatter format across all documentation

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All installation methods documented in single location
- [ ] Feature list maintained in one place
- [ ] Component documentation clearly organized
- [ ] Example listings consolidated
- [ ] Cross-references updated
- [ ] No broken internal links

## Post-Migration TODO

- Update all documentation to use standardized frontmatter
- Implement consistent navigation structure
- Add documentation index/table of contents
- Create quick-reference guides for common tasks
