# Raxol Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Raxol, a terminal application toolkit for Elixir.

This documentation focuses on using Raxol as a library to build your own interactive TUI applications.

## Key Sections

- **[Installation](installation/Installation.md):** How to add Raxol as a dependency to your Mix project.
- **[Getting Started](guides/quick_start.md):** A tutorial to build your first simple Raxol application using `Raxol.App`.
- **[Terminal Handling](terminal_emulator.md):** An overview of how Raxol interacts with the terminal (rendering, colors, input) behind the scenes.
- **[Concepts](concepts/README.md) (Planned):** Core concepts like the `Raxol.App` lifecycle, state management, event handling, and the component model.
- **[Components](components/README.md) (Planned):** Detailed documentation for the built-in UI components (e.g., `<box>`, `<text>`, `<input>`).
- **Examples:** (Link to `/examples` directory in the main repo if it exists and is relevant)
- **[Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md):** A log of changes between Raxol versions.
- **[Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md):** Guidelines for contributing to the Raxol library or its documentation.
