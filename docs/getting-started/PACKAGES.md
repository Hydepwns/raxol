# Raxol Packages

Modular architecture for incremental adoption. Choose the packages you need.

## Migration Paths

### Path 1: Minimal (CLI Tools)

Start with just terminal buffers and rendering.

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [{:raxol_core, "~> 2.0"}]
end
```

**Example:**
```elixir
alias Raxol.Core.{Buffer, Box}

Buffer.create_blank_buffer(80, 24)
|> Box.draw_box(0, 0, 80, 24, :single)
|> Buffer.write_at(10, 5, "Hello, CLI!")
|> Buffer.to_string()
|> IO.puts()
```

---

### Path 2: Web Integration

Add browser-based terminal rendering to your Phoenix app.

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    {:raxol_core, "~> 2.0"},
    {:raxol_liveview, "~> 2.0"}
  ]
end
```

**Example:**
```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.TerminalLive do
  use MyAppWeb, :live_view

  def render(assigns) do
    ~H"""
    <.live_component
      module={Raxol.LiveView.TerminalComponent}
      id="terminal"
      buffer={@buffer}
      theme={:nord}
    />
    """
  end
end
```

See [LiveView Integration Cookbook](../cookbook/LIVEVIEW_INTEGRATION.md) for complete guide.

---

### Path 3: Extensible Architecture

Build plugin-based terminal applications.

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    {:raxol_core, "~> 2.0"},
    {:raxol_plugin, "~> 2.0"}
  ]
end
```

**Example:**
```elixir
# Load and use plugins
Raxol.Plugin.Runtime.load_plugin(MyApp.SpotifyPlugin)
Raxol.Plugin.Runtime.execute_command("spotify:play")
```

See [Plugin Development Guide](../plugins/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for details.

---

### Path 4: Full Framework

Get everything in one package (coming soon).

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [{:raxol, "~> 2.0"}]  # Coming soon
end
```

Includes all features from all packages plus enterprise capabilities.

---

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Packages

Based on your needs:
- **CLI tool?** → raxol_core only
- **Web terminal?** → raxol_core + raxol_liveview
- **Extensible app?** → raxol_core + raxol_plugin
- **Everything?** → raxol (when available)

### Step 2: Add to mix.exs

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    # Choose your packages
    {:raxol_core, "~> 2.0"},
    {:raxol_liveview, "~> 2.0"},  # Optional
    {:raxol_plugin, "~> 2.0"}     # Optional
  ]
end
```

### Step 3: Fetch Dependencies

```bash
mix deps.get
```

### Step 4: Start Building

See respective documentation for each package:
- [Quickstart Guide](./QUICKSTART.md) - Get started quickly
- [Core Concepts](./CORE_CONCEPTS.md) - Understand the architecture
- [Migration Guide](./MIGRATION_FROM_DIY.md) - Migrate existing code

---

## Upgrading Between Packages

### Adding LiveView Support

Already using raxol_core and want to add web rendering?

```elixir
# Before
{:raxol_core, "~> 2.0"}

# After
{:raxol_core, "~> 2.0"},
{:raxol_liveview, "~> 2.0"}
```

No code changes needed to existing buffer logic. Just add LiveView component.

### Adding Plugin Support

```elixir
# Before
{:raxol_core, "~> 2.0"}

# After
{:raxol_core, "~> 2.0"},
{:raxol_plugin, "~> 2.0"}
```

Existing code continues to work. Add plugins incrementally.

### Upgrading to Full Framework

```elixir
# Before
{:raxol_core, "~> 2.0"},
{:raxol_liveview, "~> 2.0"},
{:raxol_plugin, "~> 2.0"}

# After
{:raxol, "~> 2.0"}  # Coming soon
```

All packages included, no API changes.

## Performance Considerations

### Package Overhead

| Package | Compile Time | Runtime Memory | Load Time |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| raxol_core | ~5s | < 2MB | < 10ms |
| raxol_liveview | ~10s | ~5MB | ~50ms |
| raxol_plugin | ~8s | ~3MB | ~30ms |
| raxol (full) | ~20s | ~10MB | ~100ms |

*Measured on M1 Mac, cold start*

### Optimization Tips

1. **Use raxol_core only** if you don't need web/plugins (fastest)
2. **Lazy load plugins** to reduce initial startup time
3. **Configure runtime: false** for testing/docs (reduces deps)
4. **Tree shaking** - Only import what you use

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need all packages?

No! Start with raxol_core and add packages as needed. They're designed for incremental adoption.

### Can I switch packages later?

Yes. All packages share the same core API. You can add or remove packages without rewriting code.

### What's the difference between raxol_liveview and raxol_web?

raxol_liveview is the new name (v2.0+). raxol_web was the v1.x name. They're the same functionality, just renamed for clarity.

### Which package should I start with?

- Building a CLI? → raxol_core
- Building a web app? → raxol_core + raxol_liveview
- Need plugins? → raxol_core + raxol_plugin
- Want everything? → Wait for raxol (full) or use all packages

### Are there version compatibility issues?

No. All packages use the same version numbering and are tested together. raxol_core 2.0 works with raxol_liveview 2.0 and raxol_plugin 2.0.

### Can I use runtime: false?

Yes! Use `{:raxol_core, "~> 2.0", runtime: false}` for:
- Documentation generation
- Testing helpers
- UI components without terminal emulator

See [README](../../README.md#components-only-mode) for details.
