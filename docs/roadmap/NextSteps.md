## Additional Visualization Types

After completing the current priorities, we plan to implement additional visualization types:

1. **Line Charts**

   - Time series data representation
   - Multi-line comparison
   - Customizable line styles and markers

2. **Scatter Plots**

   - Data point distribution visualization
   - Correlation analysis
   - Customizable point styles and sizes

3. **Heatmaps**
   - Density visualization
   - Color-coded data representation
   - Configurable color schemes

## Testing Strategy Updates

### Test Categories for Native Terminal

1. **Environment Specific Tests**

   - Terminal initialization and cleanup
   - Window resizing and content adjustment
   - Keyboard navigation and shortcuts
   - Terminal-specific features (cursor styles, etc.)
   - Theme display and switching in terminal mode

2. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Rendering speed with various terminal emulators
   - Memory usage patterns
   - CPU utilization during complex operations

### Test Automation

- Create automated test scripts for terminal environment
- Implement CI pipeline for terminal-specific tests
- Add performance regression detection

### GitHub Actions Testing

- Using `act` for local testing and debugging GitHub Actions workflows
- Docker images optimized for ARM MacOS developers (via Orbstack)
- Environment parity between local dev and CI environments
- Testing across multiple Erlang/Elixir versions and platforms
- Robust database setup for both Linux (via services) and macOS (local install)
