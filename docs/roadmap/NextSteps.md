- **Data Visualization**: Basic Chart/TreeMap components exist (TS source?), Dashboard integration via widgets.
- **Dependency Fixes**: Resolved compilation issues with `ex_termbox` dependency.
- **Compilation Stabilization**: Resolved `HEEx.Sigil not loaded` errors and various compiler warnings.
- **Plugin System Basics**: Basic mouse event handling, OSC 8 parsing, Clipboard paste injection, ImagePlugin rendering fix (needs testing).
- **Dashboard Layout Basics**: Grid layout, widget container, drag/resize, basic persistence (including options).

### Features in Progress

- **Dashboard Layout System**: Implementing actual visualization rendering via `VisualizationPlugin`.
- **Performance Monitoring & Cleanup**: Completing the performance scoring/alerting tools & resolving minor existing analysis warnings.
- **Advanced Documentation**: Creating debugging guides and optimization case studies
- **AI Integration**: Beginning implementation of AI-assisted development tools

## Tactical Pre-computation (Very Next Steps)

**COMPLETED:** Compilation is stable.

**CURRENT FOCUS:** Implement actual Chart/TreeMap rendering within the `VisualizationPlugin`.

1.  **Implement Rendering Logic:** Enhance `VisualizationPlugin.render_chart_to_cells/3` and `render_treemap_to_cells/3` to draw actual visualizations using the provided `data`, `opts`, and `bounds`. This likely involves:
    - Choosing a TUI rendering strategy (e.g., direct character manipulation, integrating with a library like `Contex`).
    - Translating `data` and `opts` into the chosen strategy's format.
    - Generating the list of cell maps `%{x, y, char, fg, bg, style}` within the given `bounds`.
2.  **Test Visualization Rendering:** Verify that charts and treemaps render correctly within their widget containers.
3.  **Verify Hyperlink OS Interaction:** Test `HyperlinkPlugin.open_url/1` on different operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows).
4.  **Run Static Analysis:** Run `mix dialyzer` and `mix credo` to catch any remaining type or style issues.

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Visualization Rendering Implementation (Current Focus)

1.  **Week X**: Research/Choose TUI rendering strategy (Contex integration? Custom drawing?).
2.  **Week X**: Implement `VisualizationPlugin.render_chart_to_cells/3`.
3.  **Week X**: Implement `VisualizationPlugin.render_treemap_to_cells/3`.
4.  **Week Y**: Test rendering, fix layout/clipping issues, test hyperlink interaction.

### Dashboard Layout System Refinements (Next)

1. **Week 1-2**: Create responsive grid layout foundation

   - Implement grid container component
   - Add responsive breakpoint system
   - Create layout configuration API

2. **Week 3-4**: Develop widget container implementation

   - Build draggable functionality
   - Implement resize controls
   - Create widget configuration panel

3. **Week 5-6**: Build dashboard persistence and configuration

   - Implement saving/loading system
   - Create default templates
   - Develop user configuration UI

4. **Week 7-8**: Visualization component integration
   - [x] Create specialized widget types for charts and TreeMaps (`ChartWidget`, `TreeMapWidget`)
   - [ ] Build data binding / configuration system (TODO)
   - [ ] Implement real-time updates (TODO)

### Testing Strategy

- Create specific tests for dashboard layout responsiveness
- Test dragging and resizing with various screen sizes
- Validate accessibility of the dashboard system
- Benchmark performance with multiple widgets

## Development Guide for Dashboard System

When implementing the dashboard system, follow these principles:

1. **Composability**: Widgets should be composable and follow consistent patterns
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure all dashboard interactions work with keyboard and screen readers
3. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize for performance with many widgets
4. **Flexibility**: Support various layouts and configurations
5. **Persistence**: Save and restore dashboard state reliably

## Contribution Areas

For developers interested in contributing, these are areas where help would be valuable:

1. **Dashboard Widget Types**: Creating additional specialized widget types
2. **Performance Optimization**: Improving dashboard rendering performance
3. **Animation System**: Implementing physics-based animations
4. **Documentation**: Creating guides for dashboard creation
5. **Testing**: Developing comprehensive tests for layout system

## Next Team Sync Focus

1. Review visualization rendering implementation.
2. Plan next steps for Dashboard Refinements (Config Panel, Data Sources).
3. Discuss priorities for Performance Tools / Animation / AI.

## Prompt for Next AI Developer

```
You are an AI assistant helping to develop the Raxol framework. The team has recently refactored the visualization widget rendering pipeline to resolve compilation issues. Charts and TreeMaps are now represented as data structures (`%{type: :chart, ...}`) processed by the Runtime, which calls rendering functions in a new `VisualizationPlugin`, passing the calculated layout bounds.

**Current Status:**
- Compilation is stable (`mix compile --warnings-as-errors` passes).
- `ChartWidget` and `TreeMapWidget` return data maps.
- `Dashboard` renders widgets, passing data maps to `WidgetContainer`.
- `Runtime.process_view_element` identifies `:chart`/`:treemap` maps and calls `VisualizationPlugin.render_*_to_cells(data, opts, bounds)`.
- `VisualizationPlugin` exists and is loaded, but `render_*_to_cells` currently draws simple placeholder boxes.
- Hyperlink click detection and OS interaction code exists but needs testing.
- ImagePlugin rendering fix implemented (needs testing).

**Your Task:**
Implement the actual rendering logic within `VisualizationPlugin.render_chart_to_cells/3` and `VisualizationPlugin.render_treemap_to_cells/3`.

**Specifically, you should:**
1.  **Choose/Implement Rendering Strategy:** Decide how to render charts/treemaps in the terminal (e.g., integrate `Contex`, use TUI drawing primitives). Implement this strategy within the plugin functions.
2.  **Use Provided Data:** Utilize the `data`, `opts`, and `bounds` arguments passed by the Runtime to generate the correct visualization within the allocated space.
3.  **Return Cell List:** Ensure the functions return a flat list of cell maps (`%{x: _, y: _, char: _, fg: _, bg: _, style: %{}}`) suitable for the Runtime's `ExTermbox.Bindings.change_cell` loop.
4.  **Test Rendering:** Verify that basic charts and treemaps render correctly within their widget containers.
5.  **(Optional/Next)** Test `HyperlinkPlugin.open_url/1` cross-platform.
6.  **(Optional/Next)** Run `mix dialyzer` and `mix credo`.

You should focus on `lib/raxol/plugins/visualization_plugin.ex`. Review the `data` and `opts` structure passed from `lib/raxol/my_app.ex` via the widgets.
