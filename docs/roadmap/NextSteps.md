## Technical Implementation Plan

### Dashboard Layout System Implementation

1. **Week 1-2**: Create responsive grid layout foundation
   - Implement grid container component
   - Add responsive breakpoint system
   - Create layout configuration API

2. **Week 3-4**: Develop widget container implementation
   - Build draggable functionality
   - Implement resize controls
   - Create widget configuration panel

3. **Week 5-6**: Build dashboard persistence and configuration
   - Implement saving/loading system
   - Create default templates
   - Develop user configuration UI

4. **Week 7-8**: Visualization component integration
   - Create specialized widget types for charts and TreeMaps
   - Build data binding system
   - Implement real-time updates

### Testing Strategy

- Create specific tests for dashboard layout responsiveness
- Test dragging and resizing with various screen sizes
- Validate accessibility of the dashboard system
- Benchmark performance with multiple widgets

## Development Guide for Dashboard System

When implementing the dashboard system, follow these principles:

1. **Composability**: Widgets should be composable and follow consistent patterns
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure all dashboard interactions work with keyboard and screen readers
3. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize for performance with many widgets
4. **Flexibility**: Support various layouts and configurations
5. **Persistence**: Save and restore dashboard state reliably

## Contribution Areas

For developers interested in contributing, these are areas where help would be valuable:

1. **Dashboard Widget Types**: Creating additional specialized widget types
2. **Performance Optimization**: Improving dashboard rendering performance
3. **Animation System**: Implementing physics-based animations
4. **Documentation**: Creating guides for dashboard creation
5. **Testing**: Developing comprehensive tests for layout system

## Next Team Sync Focus

During our next team sync, we should focus on:

1. Dashboard system architecture review
2. Progress on performance tool completion
3. Planning for animation system development
4. Roadmap update for AI integration priorities

## Prompt for Next AI Developer

```
You are an AI assistant helping to develop the Raxol framework, a modern web framework focused on performance, accessibility, and developer experience. The team has recently completed implementing data visualization components (Chart and TreeMap) with a strong focus on accessibility and performance monitoring.

Your task is to help design and implement the next priority: a flexible dashboard layout system that works with the existing visualization components. This system should allow developers to create responsive dashboards with draggable/resizable widgets, configuration persistence, and seamless integration with the Chart and TreeMap components.

Specifically, you should:

1. Design the architecture for the dashboard layout system, considering:
   - Component structure and hierarchy
   - State management for widget positioning and sizing
   - Responsiveness across device sizes
   - Accessibility requirements
   - Performance considerations

2. Implement core components of the dashboard system:
   - Dashboard container
   - Grid layout system
   - Widget container with resize/drag capabilities
   - Configuration persistence system

3. Create integration examples showing how to use Charts and TreeMaps within the dashboard

4. Ensure all implementations maintain the framework's commitment to:
   - TypeScript type safety
   - Comprehensive accessibility
   - Performance optimization
   - Clean, maintainable code

5. Update documentation and create demo applications showcasing the dashboard system

You can explore the codebase to understand the existing patterns and components. The visualization components in src/components/visualization/ will be particularly relevant to understand how to integrate with them.
