# Raxol Project Roadmap

## In Progress üöß

### Runtime Stability

- [ ] **Debug State Loss CRASH (`KeyError: :dashboard_model`)**: Determine why `RuntimeDebug` state loses the `:model` between `handle_continue/2` and `handle_info(:render)`. State confirmed correct up to `handle_continue` return. **CURRENT BLOCKER.**
- [ ] **Investigate `ex_termbox` Dimension Reporting:** Root cause of incorrect height/width reporting still needs investigation. (Workaround applied).
- [ ] **Verify Infinite Loop Fix:** Status unknown, previously blocked by other errors. Needs verification once app runs.

### Runtime Rendering Pipeline

- [ ] **Verify TUI Rendering:** Check visual output after fixes (GridContainer, ScreenBuffer). **BLOCKED by state loss crash.**
- [ ] **Verify `Unhandled view element type` Status:** Needs verification via logging (**BLOCKED by state loss crash**).
- [ ] **Verify `Skipping invalid cell change` Status:** Needs verification via logging (**BLOCKED by state loss crash**).

### Dashboard Layout System Refinements

- [x] **~~Investigate `GridContainer` Calculation:~~** **FIXED** (using rounding + fixed Runtime crash loop).
- [ ] **Refine Chart/TreeMap TUI Rendering:** Improve accuracy, layout, labeling, and aesthetics of `VisualizationPlugin` (**BLOCKED by state loss crash**).
- [ ] **Test Layout Persistence:** Verify `save_layout/1` and `load_layout/0` work correctly. (**Blocked by state loss crash**)

### Plugin System Enhancements

- [ ] **ImagePlugin Stability/Visual Testing:** Verify image (`assets/static/images/logo.png`) rendering visually (**BLOCKED by state loss crash**).
- [ ] **Hyperlink OS Interaction Testing:** Verify/test `HyperlinkPlugin.open_url/1` across different OSes. (**Blocked by state loss crash**)
- [ ] **Investigate alternative rendering mechanisms if needed (ImagePlugin).**

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] **Responsiveness Scoring System:** Define metrics, create algorithm, visualize data.
- [ ] **Performance Regression Alerting:** Configure thresholds, notification system, CI integration.
- [ ] **Animation Performance Analysis:** Monitor frame rates, identify bottlenecks.

### Documentation

- [ ] API documentation updates (reflect widget refactoring, new plugin).
- [ ] Performance tuning guidelines.
- [ ] Component lifecycle documentation.
- [ ] Event system best practices.
- [ ] Integration examples and tutorials (Dashboard, Plugins).
- [ ] Accessibility and internationalization integration guides.

## Known Issues üêû

- **RUNTIME CRASH:** **`(KeyError) key :dashboard_model not found in: %{}` in `handle_info(:render)`**: The `:model` data within the `RuntimeDebug` state is lost between `handle_continue/2` completing successfully and `handle_info(:render)` starting. State is confirmed correct up until `handle_continue` returns. **CURRENT BLOCKER**.
- **RUNTIME:** **`ex_termbox` reporting incorrect terminal dimensions:** Underlying issue masked by hardcoding workaround. Needs future investigation.
- **RUNTIME:** Potential infinite loop **needs verification** (once app runs).
- **RUNTIME:** Status of other runtime warnings (`Unhandled view element type`, `Skipping invalid cell change`) **unknown**. Needs verification (once app runs).
- **RUNTIME:** Compiler warnings exist for type mismatches in `handle_event` return clauses and many undefined function calls (see logs).
- **VISUALIZATION:** TUI Charts/TreeMaps rendering **needs visual verification and refinement** (blocked by crash).
- **IMAGE:** Image rendering (`assets/static/images/logo.png`) **needs visual verification** (blocked by crash).
- **LAYOUT:** Layout saving/loading (`~/.raxol/dashboard_layout.bin`) needs testing (blocked by crash).
- **TESTING:** `HyperlinkPlugin.open_url/1` needs cross-platform testing (blocked by crash).
- **DIALYZER:** ~86 warnings remain.
