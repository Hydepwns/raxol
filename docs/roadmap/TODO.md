- Added basic data/option passing to `ChartWidget` and `TreeMapWidget`.
- Refined Dashboard persistence to save widget options and save on change.
- Fixed `ImagePlugin` rendering interference by adjusting command output order.
- Implemented OSC 8 parsing in Runtime for hyperlink data.
- Implemented Clipboard paste injection via Runtime messaging.
- Confirmed Hyperlink click detection and OS `open_url` logic is present.
- Cleaned up Plugin behaviour implementation in `VisualizationPlugin`.

## In Progress üöß

### Dashboard Layout System Refinements

- [ ] **Implement Chart/TreeMap Rendering:** Implement actual rendering logic in `VisualizationPlugin.render_chart_to_cells/3` and `render_treemap_to_cells/3`, replacing current placeholders. (Requires integrating with a TUI charting library or custom drawing).
- [ ] **Widget Configuration Panel:** Implement UI for configuring widget properties (e.g., chart type, data source) at runtime.
- [ ] **Data Source Connection:** Define and implement how widgets (especially Chart/TreeMap) connect to and receive real data, moving beyond hardcoded data in `MyApp`.
- [ ] **Real-time Data Updating:** Implement mechanisms for widgets to subscribe to and display real-time data updates.
- [ ] **Layout Persistence Config:** Make save location configurable, improve error handling.
- [ ] **Accessibility:** Review and implement accessibility considerations for grid layout and widget interactions.
- [ ] **User Customization:** Allow users to add/remove/configure widgets beyond the defaults.

### Plugin System Enhancements

- [ ] **Hyperlink OS Interaction:** Verify/test `HyperlinkPlugin.open_url/1` across different OSes.
- [ ] **ImagePlugin Stability:** Further test `ImagePlugin` rendering fix. Consider alternative rendering mechanisms if direct `IO.write` remains problematic.

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] **Responsiveness Scoring System:** Define metrics, create algorithm, visualize data.
- [ ] **Performance Regression Alerting:** Configure thresholds, notification system, CI integration.
- [ ] **Animation Performance Analysis:** Monitor frame rates, identify bottlenecks.

### Documentation

- [ ] API documentation updates (reflect widget refactoring, new plugin).
- [ ] Performance tuning guidelines.
- [ ] Component lifecycle documentation.
- [ ] Event system best practices.
- [ ] Integration examples and tutorials (Dashboard, Plugins).
- [ ] Accessibility and internationalization integration guides.
