# Terminal Refactoring

## Overview

The terminal refactoring project has been completed, resulting in a more modular and maintainable codebase. The main emulator functionality has been split into specialized manager modules, each handling a specific aspect of terminal operation.

## Key Improvements

- Improved code organization
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced testability
- Reduced complexity in main emulator
- Clearer state management
- More maintainable codebase

## Completed Modules

- [x] BufferManager
- [x] CursorManager
- [x] StateManager
- [x] CommandManager
- [x] StyleManager
- [x] ParserStateManager
- [x] InputManager

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each manager
- Integration tests for manager interactions
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Edge case handling

## Next Steps

- Monitor performance metrics
- Gather user feedback
- Plan future improvements
- Document best practices
