# Database Connection Issues - Fixed

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the database connection issues in the Raxol application.

## Problem

After an application crash, Postgrex would show connection errors when attempting to restart the application. This indicated that database connections weren't being properly cleaned up or managed.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive set of improvements to address these issues:

### 1. Repository Configuration

- Removed custom pool specification (`DBConnection.Poolboy`) in favor of the default Ecto pool
- Simplified the Repo initialization in the application supervision tree
- Added better timeout settings for database connections
- Fixed the `start_link` parameters in the Supervisor child spec
- Added connection health checks during application startup

### 2. Connection Management

Created a dedicated connection management system:

- `Raxol.Database.ConnectionManager` module for handling connections with retry logic
- Implemented exponential backoff for connection retries
- Added classification of errors as retryable or non-retryable based on Postgres error codes
- Added connection health monitoring

### 3. Database Context

Created a safe database interface:

- `Raxol.Database` module with functions that wrap operations in retry logic
- Standardized error handling for database operations
- Added transaction support with retry capabilities
- Provided convenient functions for common database operations

### 4. Repo Enhancements

Enhanced the Repo module:

- Added runtime configuration support through environment variables
- Added init callback for better logging and configuration
- Implemented custom query functions with detailed logging
- Added error handling for database queries

### 5. Diagnostic Tools

Created tools for diagnosing database issues:

- `scripts/setup_db.sh` for setting up or resetting the database
- `scripts/check_db.exs` for quickly checking database connections
- `scripts/diagnose_db.exs` for detailed diagnostics

### 6. Documentation

- Added database documentation in `docs/database/README.md`
- Updated roadmap and TODO lists
- Created this changes summary document

## Impact

These changes provide significant improvements to database reliability:

- Automatic recovery from transient connection errors
- Better error reporting and logging
- Simplified database operations with built-in safety
- Tools for diagnosing and fixing database issues
- Environment-variable-based configuration overrides

## Further Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

- Add monitoring for connection pool usage
- Implement query timeouts and cancellation
- Add more sophisticated database metrics
- Create admin tools for database management
- Add performance optimization for common queries
