# Performance Monitoring

The Raxol terminal emulator includes a comprehensive performance monitoring system that allows you to track and analyze the performance of your UI components. This guide will help you understand how to use the performance monitoring system to optimize your application.

## Overview

The performance monitoring system is built around the `ViewPerformance` class, which provides methods for tracking component creation, rendering, updates, and operations. The system collects metrics such as:

- Component creation time
- Component render time
- Component update count
- Component child count
- Memory usage
- Timing metrics
- Component operation metrics

## Getting Started

To use the performance monitoring system, you need to get an instance of the `ViewPerformance` class and start monitoring:

```typescript
import { ViewPerformance } from 'raxol/core/performance';

// Get an instance of the ViewPerformance class
const viewPerformance = ViewPerformance.getInstance();

// Start monitoring
viewPerformance.startMonitoring();

// Your application code here

// Stop monitoring when done
viewPerformance.stopMonitoring();
```

## Recording Component Metrics

The `ViewPerformance` class provides methods for recording various component metrics:

### Component Creation

```typescript
// Record component creation metrics
viewPerformance.recordComponentCreate('box', 10); // 10ms to create
```

### Component Rendering

```typescript
// Record component render metrics
viewPerformance.recordComponentRender('box', 20, 5); // 20ms to render, 5 children
```

### Component Updates

```typescript
// Record component update metrics
viewPerformance.recordComponentUpdate('box', 15); // 15ms to update
```

### Component Operations

```typescript
// Record component operation metrics
viewPerformance.recordComponentOperation('render', 25, 'box'); // 25ms to render box component
```

## Retrieving Metrics

The `ViewPerformance` class provides methods for retrieving various metrics:

### Overall Performance Metrics

```typescript
// Get overall performance metrics
const metrics = viewPerformance.getMetrics();
console.log(metrics.memory); // Memory usage
console.log(metrics.timing); // Timing metrics
console.log(metrics.rendering); // Rendering metrics
```

### Component-Specific Metrics

```typescript
// Get metrics for a specific component type
const boxMetrics = viewPerformance.getComponentMetrics('box');
console.log(boxMetrics?.createTime); // Creation time
console.log(boxMetrics?.renderTime); // Render time
console.log(boxMetrics?.updateCount); // Update count
console.log(boxMetrics?.childCount); // Child count
```

### All Component Metrics

```typescript
// Get metrics for all components
const allMetrics = viewPerformance.getAllComponentMetrics();
allMetrics.forEach(metrics => {
  console.log(`${metrics.type}: ${metrics.createTime}ms to create, ${metrics.renderTime}ms to render`);
});
```

### Component Operation Metrics

```typescript
// Get all component operation metrics
const allOperationMetrics = viewPerformance.getAllOperationMetrics();
allOperationMetrics.forEach(metric => {
  console.log(`${metric.operation} for ${metric.componentType}: ${metric.operationTime}ms`);
});

// Get operation metrics for a specific component type
const boxOperationMetrics = viewPerformance.getOperationMetricsByComponentType('box');
boxOperationMetrics.forEach(metric => {
  console.log(`${metric.operation}: ${metric.operationTime}ms`);
});

// Get operation metrics for a specific operation
const renderOperationMetrics = viewPerformance.getOperationMetricsByOperation('render');
renderOperationMetrics.forEach(metric => {
  console.log(`${metric.componentType}: ${metric.operationTime}ms`);
});
```

## Performance Dashboard

The Raxol terminal emulator includes a performance dashboard that visualizes the metrics collected by the `ViewPerformance` class. To use the performance dashboard, you need to import the `PerformanceDashboard` component and pass it the metrics:

```typescript
import { PerformanceDashboard } from 'raxol/components/PerformanceDashboard';
import { ViewPerformance } from 'raxol/core/performance';

// Get an instance of the ViewPerformance class
const viewPerformance = ViewPerformance.getInstance();

// Start monitoring
viewPerformance.startMonitoring();

// Your application code here

// Get metrics
const metrics = viewPerformance.getMetrics();
const componentMetrics = viewPerformance.getAllComponentMetrics();
const operationMetrics = viewPerformance.getAllOperationMetrics();

// Render the performance dashboard
const dashboard = PerformanceDashboard({
  metrics,
  componentMetrics,
  operationMetrics
});

// Stop monitoring when done
viewPerformance.stopMonitoring();
```

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices for using the performance monitoring system:

1. **Start monitoring early**: Start monitoring as early as possible in your application lifecycle to capture all performance metrics.

2. **Stop monitoring when done**: Stop monitoring when you're done collecting metrics to avoid unnecessary overhead.

3. **Focus on critical components**: Pay special attention to components that are rendered frequently or have complex logic.

4. **Monitor memory usage**: Keep an eye on memory usage to avoid memory leaks.

5. **Use operation metrics for debugging**: Use operation metrics to identify slow operations and optimize them.

6. **Set performance budgets**: Set performance budgets for your components and monitor them to ensure they stay within acceptable limits.

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing performance issues, here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check component creation time**: If component creation time is high, consider lazy loading or code splitting.

2. **Check component render time**: If component render time is high, consider optimizing your rendering logic or using virtualization.

3. **Check component update count**: If component update count is high, consider using memoization or reducing unnecessary updates.

4. **Check memory usage**: If memory usage is high, check for memory leaks or consider garbage collection.

5. **Check operation metrics**: If specific operations are slow, optimize them or consider alternatives.

## Conclusion

The performance monitoring system in Raxol provides a comprehensive set of tools for tracking and analyzing the performance of your UI components. By using these tools effectively, you can identify and resolve performance issues, resulting in a smoother and more responsive user experience.
