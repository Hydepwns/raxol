# Raxol Development Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level roadmap for the Raxol TUI framework.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Largely Complete)

- Core Architecture Refactoring (Runtime, Events, Rendering Basis)
- Basic Styling System (`Theming`, `ColorSystem` basics)
- Essential UI Components (`Base.Component`, core inputs/displays)
- Initial Plugin System
- Basic Documentation & Examples

## Phase 2: Feature Expansion & Stabilization (In Progress)

- **Component Library Growth:**
  - Add missing component types (e.g., Navigation: Tabs, Pagination; Password Input).
  - Refine existing components (e.g., Multi-select enhancements).
  - Improve test coverage for all components.
- **Styling System Enhancements:**
  - Implement extended border styles (rounded, thick, double).
  - Explore adaptive background detection.
  - Refine theme definitions and palettes.
- **Performance & Rendering:**
  - Implement core terminal command handling (CSI, OSC, DCS).
  - Stabilize and enhance core input components (TextInput, MultiLineInput).
  - Optimize rendering pipeline.
  - Benchmark core operations.
- **API Stabilization:**
  - Solidify public APIs for Core, UI, View.
  - Improve ExDoc coverage.
- **Documentation & Examples:**
  - Complete Component Showcase.
  - Develop more comprehensive guides and tutorials.
- **Accessibility & UX:**
  - Full integration of `UserPreferences`.
  - Refine focus management and keyboard navigation.
  - Test high-contrast mode thoroughly.

## Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (Future)

- **Animation System:**
  - Develop core animation framework (physics-based, easing).
  - Integrate into components (e.g., FocusRing, transitions).
- **Markdown Rendering Component:**
  - Build terminal-optimized markdown display.
  - Add syntax highlighting and theming.
- **Form System:**
  - Design and implement form framework (`Huh` equivalent).
  - Include field types, validation, accessibility.
- **Internationalization (i18n):**
  - Lay groundwork for i18n support.
  - Integrate with components and accessibility.

## Phase 4: Ecosystem & Polish (Future)

- **Ecosystem Tools Exploration:**
  - CLI Enhancement Tools (`Gum` equivalent).
  - Terminal Recording (`VHS` equivalent).
- **Burrito Integration (Exploratory):**
  - Investigate seamless packaging and distribution.
  - Address performance and dependency management.
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - In-depth profiling and optimization.
- **Testing:**
  - Comprehensive cross-platform testing.
  - Visual regression testing.
- **Documentation:**
  - Finalize all guides, tutorials, API docs.
  - Create showcase applications.

_Note: Phases and timelines are estimates and subject to change based on development progress and priorities._
