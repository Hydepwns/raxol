- [x] Task 4.4: Test ExDoc Generation (`mix docs`).
- [x] Improve README Example.
- [x] **Component System Documentation:**
  - [x] Comprehensive API, lifecycle, and architecture documentation is now harmonized and cross-linked across README, ARCHITECTURE.md, API reference, and architecture guide.
  - [x] Add component lifecycle documentation
  - [x] Add component composition patterns guide
  - [x] Add testing patterns guide
  - [x] Add style guide for components
  - [x] Update component README with API reference links
- [x] **Testing Framework Documentation:**
  - [x] Document test helper modules
  - [x] Add examples for event-based testing
  - [x] Add performance testing guide
  - [x] Add troubleshooting section
  - [x] Update best practices
- [ ] **Pre-commit Script Maintenance (`scripts/pre_commit_check.exs`):**
  - [x] Improve file discovery to include hidden directories (e.g., `.github/`) and normalize paths.
  - [x] Explicitly include key project READMEs in the known file set.
  - [x] Temporarily disable anchor checking (`#anchor-links`) due to parsing complexities. File existence checks are active.
  - [ ] **Re-implement Robust Anchor Checking:** Develop a reliable method for parsing and validating anchor links within Markdown files for the pre-commit script.
- [x] Continue refactoring large files (see docs/changes/LARGE_FILES_FOR_REFACTOR.md for tracking and guidelines)
- [x] Track large or growing test helper files in the same document

## High Priority

- [x] Fix Manager.Behaviour/mock issue in file watcher tests to unblock test suite.

- [x] Re-run test suite and update failure/skipped/invalid counts.
- [x] Restore and fix Raxol.Terminal.DriverTestHelper (helper import, pattern match, and assertion issues resolved; test suite now proceeds past helper errors).
- [x] Fix Test Failures: Address remaining test failures (currently 1023 failures, 12 skipped, 34 doctests; KeyError for :single_shift resolved; next focus: scroll region/handle_r/2 and screen resizing failures).
- [x] Table theming/lifecycle/test improvements complete. Table now supports style and theme props, per-column style/header_style, and is fully documented and tested.
- [x] SelectList theming/lifecycle/test improvements complete. SelectList now supports style and theme props, per-option style, and is fully documented and tested.
- [x] TextInput theming/lifecycle/test improvements complete. TextInput now supports style and theme props, and is fully documented and tested.
- [x] TextField theming/lifecycle/test improvements complete. TextField now supports style and theme props, and is fully documented and tested.

- [x] Progress theming/lifecycle/test improvements complete. Progress now supports harmonized style and theme prop merging, accessibility/extra props, and is fully documented and tested.
- [ ] Next vital component: \***\*\_\_\*\*** (placeholder for future refactor)

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Component Enhancements:**
  - [x] Implement `Table` features: pagination buttons, filtering, sorting.
  - [x] Implement `FocusRing` styling based on state/effects.
  - [x] Enhance `SelectList`: stateful scroll offset, robust focus management, search/filtering.
  - [x] Complete component system documentation
  - [x] Fix SelectList component implementation
  - All advanced SelectList features (custom rendering, filtering, navigation, empty state, case insensitivity) are now covered by real tests.
  - [x] Table: Theming and API refactor complete (supports `style` and `theme` props, per-column style/header_style, fully documented and tested)
  - [x] SelectList: Advanced theming, style, and lifecycle/test improvements complete

  - [ ] Optimize event processing
  - [ ] Improve concurrent operation handling
  - [ ] Implement proper performance metrics
- [ ] **Component Responsiveness & Lifecycle Improvements:**
  - [ ] Audit all UI components for complete lifecycle hook coverage (`init`, `mount`, `update`, `render`, `handle_event`, `unmount`).
  - [ ] Add or improve `mount/1` and `unmount/1` for components needing setup/teardown (timers, subscriptions, etc).
  - [ ] Ensure all components respond to `max_height`, `max_width`, and layout/style changes (responsiveness).
  - [ ] Address outstanding TODOs in components (e.g., scrolling, cursor rendering, placeholder styling).
  - [ ] Add/expand tests for:
    - [ ] Mounting/unmounting (resource cleanup, event detachment)
    - [ ] Prop updates (state preservation, reactivity)
    - [ ] Dynamic resizing/layout changes
  - [ ] Document and track any components that cannot be made fully responsive or lifecycle-complete.
  - [x] Table: Theming and API refactor complete (supports `style` and `theme` props, per-column style/header_style, fully documented and tested)
  - [x] SelectList: Advanced theming, style, and lifecycle/test improvements

## Low Priority

- [ ] **Investigate/Fix Potential Text Wrapping Off-by-one Error:** (`lib/raxol/components/input/text_wrapping.ex`).
- [ ] **Extend System Interaction Adapter Pattern:** After achieving platform stability, systematically identify and refactor other relevant modules to use the System Interaction Adapter pattern.

## Current Test Suite Status (2025-06-10)

- **Total Tests:** 2191
- **Doctests:** 34
- **Failures:** 1023
- **Skipped:** 12

**KeyError for :single_shift is resolved.**
Major failures now include scroll region assertion (handle_r/2 in CSIHandlers not implemented) and screen resizing assertion errors.
Next step: focus on scroll region/handle_r/2 and screen resizing failures.
All CharacterSets aliasing issues resolved; codebase now consistently uses Raxol.Terminal.CharacterSets

## Test Suite Remediation Action Plan (2025-05-10)

- Memory usage estimation is now covered by both unit and integration tests for `estimate_memory_usage/1` in the memory manager.

- [x] Prioritize unskipping tests that are blocked only by minor refactors or helper updates. These include visual/snapshot tests, alignment/layout tests, and tests skipped due to missing helpers or minor API changes. Review and update these tests before tackling feature-blocked or obsolete tests. (See prioritized table in test_tracking.md)

- [x] Fix plugin dependency resolver (Tarjan's algorithm, optional version mismatches).
