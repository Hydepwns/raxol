# Accessibility and Color System Integration

This document explains how the Raxol framework integrates accessibility features with the color system to create inclusive terminal UI applications.

## Overview

The Raxol framework provides a comprehensive approach to accessibility in terminal UI applications, with special attention to color system integration. This ensures that applications built with Raxol are usable by people with various visual impairments and preferences.

## Key Integration Points

### High Contrast Mode

When high contrast mode is enabled through `Accessibility.set_high_contrast(true)` or via user preferences:

- The color system automatically adjusts all theme colors to ensure sufficient contrast
- Focus indicators become more prominent
- Border colors are enhanced for better visibility
- Text colors are adjusted to maintain WCAG AA compliance (minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text)

```elixir
# Example: Enabling high contrast mode
UserPreferences.set(:high_contrast, true)

# Colors will automatically adjust across the application
```

### Reduced Motion

The color system's animation features respect the reduced motion setting:

- Color transitions are simplified or disabled
- Flashing effects are removed
- Animation durations are shortened or eliminated

```elixir
# Example: Enabling reduced motion
UserPreferences.set(:reduced_motion, true)

# All animations, including color transitions, will be adjusted
```

### Screen Reader Announcements

The color system integrates with screen readers by:

- Announcing theme changes
- Providing color information when relevant
- Describing visual elements in an accessible way

```elixir
# When a theme changes, screen readers will announce it
UserPreferences.set(:theme, :dark)
# Screen reader announces: "Dark theme applied"
```

### User Preferences

User preferences for colors are stored persistently and applied consistently:

- Theme preferences (light, dark, high contrast)
- Accent color customization
- Focus highlight style preferences

```elixir
# Setting color preferences
UserPreferences.set(:theme, :dark)
UserPreferences.set(:accent_color, "#FF5722")
UserPreferences.set(:focus_highlight_style, :bold)

# Saving preferences for persistence
UserPreferences.save()
```

## Color Contrast Calculation

The framework includes utilities for calculating and ensuring sufficient color contrast:

```elixir
# In tests
assert_sufficient_contrast(foreground_color, background_color)

# In application code
contrast_ratio = ColorSystem.calculate_contrast(foreground, background)
is_accessible = contrast_ratio >= 4.5 # WCAG AA standard for normal text
```

## Implementation Details

### Color Transformation for Accessibility

When high contrast mode is enabled, colors are transformed using these principles:

1. **Contrast Enhancement**: Increase the contrast between foreground and background colors
2. **Brightness Adjustment**: Ensure light colors are lighter and dark colors are darker
3. **Saturation Control**: Reduce excessive saturation that can cause visual strain
4. **Pattern Differentiation**: Ensure adjacent UI elements have distinguishable colors

### Theme Switching

Theme switching respects accessibility settings:

```elixir
# Applying a theme while respecting accessibility settings
ColorSystem.apply_theme(:dark, respect_accessibility: true)
```

When `respect_accessibility` is true (default), the theme colors will be adjusted based on the current accessibility settings.

## Testing Accessibility

The framework provides comprehensive testing tools for accessibility:

```elixir
# Testing high contrast mode
with_high_contrast fn ->
  # Test code with high contrast enabled
  assert ColorSystem.get_color(:primary) != original_primary
  assert_sufficient_contrast(ColorSystem.get_color(:primary), ColorSystem.get_color(:background))
end

# Testing screen reader announcements
with_screen_reader_spy fn ->
  ColorSystem.apply_theme(:high_contrast)
  assert_announced("high contrast theme")
end
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always test with accessibility features enabled**
2. **Use the built-in color system rather than hard-coding colors**
3. **Respect user preferences for colors and contrast**
4. **Provide alternative ways to convey information beyond color**
5. **Test with screen readers to ensure proper announcements**
