# Raxol Development Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level roadmap for the Raxol TUI framework.
_Note: Phases and timelines are estimates and subject to change. Current critical blockers (Mox compilation issue) must be resolved before full-scale progress on some items can resume._

## Phase 1: Foundation (Largely Complete)

- Core Architecture Refactoring (Runtime, Events, Rendering Basis)
- Basic Styling System (`Theming`, `ColorSystem` basics)
- Essential UI Components (`Base.Component`, core inputs/displays)
- Initial Plugin System
- Basic Documentation & Examples

## Phase 2: Feature Expansion & Stabilization (In Progress)

- **Overarching Priorities:**
  - Resolve Test Environment Blockers (Mox compilation error, address remaining skipped tests).
  - Achieve Comprehensive Test Coverage and Stability across the application.
- **Core Framework & API Maturation:**
  - Solidify Public APIs (Core, UI, View) and Enhance ExDoc coverage.
  - Stabilize and Optimize Rendering Pipeline & Core Operations (pending test stability).
  - Continue Maturing Terminal Command Handling (CSI, OSC, DCS).
- **Component Ecosystem Development:**
  - Expand Component Library with key missing types (e.g., Navigation Tabs, Password Input).
  - Continue Enhancing Existing Components (focus on usability, features, and thorough testing).
- **User Experience & Accessibility:**
  - Refine Focus Management, Keyboard Navigation, and High-Contrast Support.
  - Ensure Full `UserPreferences` Integration and comprehensive testing.
- **Documentation Excellence:**
  - Complete Comprehensive Guides, Tutorials, and Component Showcase.
  - Maintain High-Quality README, API Documentation, and inline ExDoc.
- **Advanced Terminal Features:**
  - Implement Advanced Terminal Input Handling (e.g., tab completion, enhanced mouse events).
  - Support Advanced Character Sets and Feature Detection.
  - Implement AI Content Generation Stubs.
- **Code Health & Maintainability:**
  - Address Technical Debt (e.g., refactor large files like `parser.ex`, deduplicate code).
  - Investigate and Resolve Known Minor Issues (e.g., text wrapping, SIXEL precision).

## Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (Future)

- **Animation System:**
  - Develop core animation framework (easing functions implemented, physics-based).
  - Integrate animations broadly into components for smoother transitions and effects.
- **Markdown Rendering Component:**
  - Build a terminal-optimized markdown display component.
  - Include features like syntax highlighting and theming.
- **Form System:**
  - Design and implement a comprehensive form framework (building on existing Modal form capabilities).
  - Include various field types, robust validation, and accessibility.
- **Internationalization (i18n):**
  - Lay groundwork for full i18n support.
  - Integrate with components and accessibility features.
- **System Interaction Abstraction:**
  - Systematically extend the System Interaction Adapter pattern to other relevant modules to improve testability and isolate dependencies.

## Phase 4: Ecosystem & Polish (Future)

- **Ecosystem Tools Exploration:**
  - Investigate and potentially develop CLI Enhancement Tools (`Gum` equivalent).
  - Explore Terminal Recording capabilities (`VHS` equivalent).
- **Burrito Integration (Exploratory):**
  - Investigate seamless packaging and distribution using Burrito.
  - Address potential performance and dependency management challenges.
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Conduct in-depth profiling and targeted optimization post-stabilization.
- **Testing:**
  - Implement comprehensive cross-platform testing.
  - Explore visual regression testing.
- **Documentation:**
  - Finalize all guides, tutorials, and API documentation.
  - Create showcase applications demonstrating Raxol's capabilities.

_Note: Phases and timelines are estimates and subject to change based on development progress and priorities._
