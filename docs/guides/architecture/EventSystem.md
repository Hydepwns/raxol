# Event System Architecture

## Overview

The Raxol event system provides a robust, event-driven architecture for handling various types of events throughout the application lifecycle. The system is designed to be reliable, testable, and maintainable.

## Core Events

### Runtime Events

- `:runtime_initialized` - Emitted when the runtime is initialized
- `:plugin_manager_ready` - Emitted when the plugin manager is ready

### Plugin Manager Events

- `:command_processed` - Emitted when a command is processed
- `:plugin_load_attempted` - Emitted when a plugin load is attempted

### Component Manager Events

- `:component_queued_for_render` - Emitted when a component is queued for rendering

### Accessibility Events

- `:preferences_applied` - Emitted when preferences are applied
- `:text_scale_updated` - Emitted when text scale is updated

## Event Flow

1. **Event Generation**

   - Events are generated by various system components
   - Each event has a type and associated data
   - Events follow a standardized format

2. **Event Processing**

   - Events are processed through the event dispatcher
   - Plugins can filter and modify events
   - Events are routed to appropriate handlers

3. **Event Handling**
   - Components handle events through their `handle_event/2` callback
   - Commands can be returned as part of event handling
   - State updates trigger re-rendering when needed

## Testing and Reliability

The event system has been improved to support reliable testing:

1. **Event-Based Synchronization**

   - Replaced `Process.sleep` calls with event-based synchronization
   - Tests now wait for specific events instead of arbitrary delays
   - Improved test reliability and determinism

2. **Event Assertions**

   - Added helper functions for asserting event propagation
   - Support for verifying event ordering and timing
   - Better error messages for test failures

3. **Test Isolation**
   - Each test runs in isolation
   - Events are properly cleaned up after tests
   - No interference between test cases

## Best Practices

1. **Event Handling**

   - Keep event handlers focused and specific
   - Use pattern matching for clear event handling
   - Return appropriate commands from event handlers

2. **Testing**

   - Use event-based synchronization instead of sleeps
   - Assert specific events rather than timing
   - Clean up event subscriptions after tests

3. **Error Handling**
   - Log errors appropriately
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

## Example Usage

```elixir
# Subscribing to events
def init(_props) do
  {:ok, sub} = EventManager.subscribe([:key_press, :mouse_click])
  %{subscription: sub}
end

# Handling events
def handle_event(%Event{type: :key_press} = event, state) do
  # Handle key press
  {new_state, commands}
end

# Cleaning up
def terminate(state) do
  EventManager.unsubscribe(state.subscription)
end
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Event Batching**

   - Implement event batching for performance
   - Add priority-based event processing
   - Support for event throttling

2. **Event Persistence**

   - Add support for event replay
   - Implement event logging
   - Support for event debugging

3. **Event Analytics**
   - Add event metrics collection
   - Support for event visualization
   - Performance monitoring
