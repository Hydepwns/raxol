# Window Handlers and Test Infrastructure

## Overview

The window handlers system provides a robust implementation of terminal window manipulation operations, with comprehensive test coverage and performance benchmarks. The system is designed to be maintainable, testable, and performant.

## Architecture

### Window Handlers

The `WindowHandlers` module is responsible for processing window manipulation commands (CSI t). It provides:

- Parameter validation and error handling
- Window state management
- Screen buffer resizing
- Window operation reporting

### Test Infrastructure

The test infrastructure consists of two main helper modules:

1. `PerformanceTestHelper`: Provides utilities for:

   - Measuring operation execution time
   - Asserting performance requirements
   - Handling concurrent operation testing

2. `WindowTestHelper`: Manages:
   - Test data generation
   - Emulator setup
   - Window operation definitions
   - Parameter validation test cases

## Performance Requirements

Window operations must meet the following performance requirements:

- Basic operations (move, resize, etc.): < 1ms average
- Reporting operations: < 1ms average
- Parameter validation: < 1ms average
- Buffer resize: < 5ms average
- Concurrent operations: < 2ms average per operation

## Usage

### Writing Window Handler Tests

```elixir
defmodule MyWindowHandlerTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  alias Raxol.Test.WindowTestHelper
  alias Raxol.Test.PerformanceTestHelper

  setup do
    {:ok, emulator: WindowTestHelper.create_test_emulator()}
  end

  test "window operation performance", %{emulator: emulator} do
    for {params, name} <- WindowTestHelper.basic_window_operations() do
      PerformanceTestHelper.assert_performance(
        fn -> WindowHandlers.handle_t(emulator, params) end,
        name
      )
    end
  end
end
```

### Adding New Window Operations

1. Add operation parameters to `WindowTestHelper`
2. Implement handler in `WindowHandlers`
3. Add performance test
4. Update documentation

## Future Improvements

1. Performance Optimization:

   - Add performance regression tests
   - Implement window operation batching
   - Improve window resize performance

2. State Management:

   - Implement window state persistence
   - Add window operation queuing
   - Improve window state synchronization

3. Error Handling:

   - Add window operation cancellation
   - Implement window operation timeouts
   - Add window operation logging

4. Monitoring:
   - Implement window operation metrics
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Create operation analytics

## Contributing

When contributing to the window handlers:

1. Follow the established patterns for parameter validation
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Include performance benchmarks
4. Update documentation
5. Ensure error messages are clear and helpful
