# Internationalization and Accessibility Integration

This document explains how the Raxol internationalization (i18n) system integrates with accessibility features to create inclusive terminal UI applications.

## Overview

The Raxol framework provides a comprehensive approach to internationalization that works seamlessly with accessibility features. This integration ensures that applications built with Raxol are accessible to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds and with various accessibility needs.

## Key Integration Points

### Screen Reader Announcements

The i18n system integrates with screen readers by:

- Providing translated screen reader announcements
- Ensuring proper pronunciation of terms in different languages
- Supporting language-specific screen reader behaviors

```elixir
# Example: Announcing a translated message to screen readers
message = Raxol.Core.I18n.t("alerts.file_saved", %{filename: "document.txt"})
Raxol.Core.Accessibility.announce_to_screen_reader(message)
```

### Right-to-Left (RTL) Language Support

When RTL languages are detected:

- UI layout automatically adjusts for RTL reading direction
- Focus navigation adapts to RTL flow
- Keyboard shortcuts may be adjusted for RTL users

```elixir
# Example: Checking if current locale is RTL
if Raxol.Core.I18n.rtl?() do
  # Adjust layout for RTL
  layout = Raxol.UI.Layout.with_direction(:rtl)
end
```

### Locale-Specific Accessibility Features

Different locales may have specific accessibility requirements:

- Language-specific color contrast requirements
- Cultural considerations for color meanings
- Locale-specific keyboard shortcuts

```elixir
# Example: Getting locale-specific accessibility settings
locale_settings = Raxol.Core.I18n.get_locale_accessibility_settings()
```

### User Preferences Integration

User language preferences are stored alongside accessibility preferences:

```elixir
# Setting language preference
UserPreferences.set(:locale, "fr")

# Saving preferences for persistence
UserPreferences.save()
```

## Implementation Details

### Translated Accessibility Messages

The i18n system provides translations for all accessibility-related messages:

```elixir
# Translations for screen reader announcements
Raxol.Core.I18n.register_translations("en", %{
  "accessibility.high_contrast_enabled" => "High contrast mode enabled",
  "accessibility.reduced_motion_enabled" => "Reduced motion mode enabled"
})

Raxol.Core.I18n.register_translations("fr", %{
  "accessibility.high_contrast_enabled" => "Mode contraste élevé activé",
  "accessibility.reduced_motion_enabled" => "Mode mouvement réduit activé"
})
```

### Locale Detection and Accessibility

The system can detect the user's preferred locale from system settings and adjust accessibility features accordingly:

```elixir
# Detecting system locale and applying appropriate settings
system_locale = Raxol.Core.I18n.detect_system_locale()
Raxol.Core.I18n.set_locale(system_locale)
```

### Dynamic Language Switching

When language is switched at runtime:

- Screen reader is notified of language change
- Accessibility announcements are updated
- Focus is maintained appropriately

```elixir
# Switching language at runtime
Raxol.Core.I18n.set_locale("es")
# Screen reader announces: "Idioma cambiado a Español"
```

## Testing Internationalization with Accessibility

The framework provides testing tools for i18n and accessibility integration:

```elixir
# Testing screen reader announcements in different languages
with_locale("fr") do
  with_screen_reader_spy fn ->
    # Trigger action that should make announcement
    UserPreferences.set(:high_contrast, true)
    
    # Assert announcement in French
    assert_announced("Mode contraste élevé activé")
  end
end

# Testing RTL layout
with_locale("ar") do
  # Test code with Arabic locale
  assert Raxol.Core.I18n.rtl?()
  # Test that UI components are properly aligned for RTL
end
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use the i18n system for user-facing text**
2. **Test with screen readers in multiple languages**
3. **Consider cultural differences in accessibility needs**
4. **Ensure keyboard shortcuts work across different keyboard layouts**
5. **Provide locale-specific help and documentation**

## Locale-Specific Accessibility Considerations

### Right-to-Left (RTL) Languages

For languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian:

- Navigation flows from right to left
- Focus order is reversed
- Keyboard shortcuts may need adjustment
- Text alignment is right-justified

### CJK Languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)

For CJK languages:

- Font size may need adjustment for legibility
- Character spacing considerations
- Screen reader pronunciation rules differ
- Input method considerations

### Languages with Diacritical Marks

For languages with extensive use of diacritical marks:

- Font selection is important for legibility
- Color contrast needs special attention
- Screen readers need proper language settings
