## Introduction

Performance testing is critical for ensuring Raxol applications deliver responsive experiences even with large datasets and complex visualizations. This guide outlines the tools and methodologies for measuring and optimizing performance.

## Benchmarking Tools

Raxol provides several built-in benchmarking tools:

### General Performance Benchmarks

- `Raxol.Benchmarks.RuntimeBenchmark`: Measures core runtime performance
- `Raxol.Benchmarks.PluginBenchmark`: Tests plugin loading and execution time
- `Raxol.Benchmarks.EventBenchmark`: Evaluates event handling performance

### Visualization Benchmarks

- `Raxol.Benchmarks.VisualizationBenchmark`: Comprehensive visualization benchmark suite
- `Raxol.Benchmarks.VisualizationBenchmarkSimple`: Simplified testing without external dependencies
- `Raxol.Benchmarks.VisualizationBenchmarkRealistic`: Realistic scenarios with progressive data sizes

## Running Benchmarks

### Using Mix Tasks

The easiest way to run benchmarks is using mix tasks:

```bash
# Run small visualization benchmark
mix benchmark.visualization small

# Run medium visualization benchmark
mix benchmark.visualization medium

# Run large visualization benchmark
mix benchmark.visualization large

# Run production-level benchmark
mix benchmark.visualization production
```

### Customizing Benchmarks

For more control, you can run benchmarks programmatically:

```elixir
# Run with custom options
Raxol.Benchmarks.VisualizationBenchmark.run_benchmark([
  output_path: "custom/output/path",
  datasets: [10, 500, 2000, 10000],
  iterations: 10,
  cache_test: true,
  memory_test: true
])
```

## Visualization Performance

Visualization components have been extensively optimized with a focus on caching and memory management.

### Latest Benchmark Results

Recent benchmarks demonstrate exceptional performance improvements:

| Component | Without Cache | With Cache | Speedup Factor |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Charts    | ~350ms        | ~0.06ms    | 5,852.9x       |
| TreeMaps  | ~757ms        | ~0.05ms    | 15,140.4x      |

These results were obtained using the `mix benchmark.visualization production` task with datasets ranging from 10 to 50,000 data points.

### Performance Factors

Several factors impact visualization performance:

1. **Dataset Size**: Larger datasets require more processing time
2. **Visualization Complexity**: TreeMaps are typically more complex than basic charts
3. **Cache Effectiveness**: Caching provides the most benefit for repeated renders
4. **Render Area Size**: Larger display areas require more cell calculations
5. **Data Volatility**: Frequently changing data reduces cache effectiveness

## Interpreting Results

Benchmark output includes several key metrics:

- **Average Render Time**: The mean time to render a visualization
- **Min/Max Time**: The range of render times across iterations
- **Standard Deviation**: Indicates consistency of performance
- **Memory Usage**: Tracks memory consumption during rendering
- **Scaling Efficiency**: How well performance scales with dataset size
- **Cache Performance**: The speedup factor achieved through caching

## Continuous Performance Testing

To integrate performance testing into your development workflow:

1. **Add to CI Pipeline**: Run `mix benchmark.visualization small` in CI
2. **Performance Regression Testing**: Compare results between commits
3. **Performance Budgets**: Set maximum acceptable render times
4. **Automated Reports**: Generate historical performance reports

## Best Practices

For reliable performance testing:

1. **Consistent Environment**: Run benchmarks on the same hardware when comparing
2. **Multiple Iterations**: Always run multiple iterations to account for variability
3. **Realistic Data**: Test with data similar to production scenarios
4. **Isolated Tests**: Avoid running other processes during benchmarks
5. **Profile Bottlenecks**: Use profiling tools to identify specific slowdowns
6. **Test Different Sizes**: Always test with varying dataset sizes to understand scaling behavior

## Conclusion

The visualization performance optimizations in Raxol provide exceptional rendering speeds, especially for cached content. The 5,852.9x and 15,140.4x speedups for charts and TreeMaps respectively represent significant achievements in rendering efficiency. These optimizations ensure smooth performance even with large datasets and complex visualizations.
