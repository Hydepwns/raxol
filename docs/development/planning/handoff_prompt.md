# Development Handoff: Raxol UX Refinement & Accessibility

I've been working on enhancing the Raxol framework with comprehensive UX refinement and accessibility features. Here's what I've accomplished so far and what I'd like you to help me with next.

## What's Been Completed

1. **Accessibility Module**: (Core logic, ThemeIntegration listener)
2. **Theme Integration**: (Basic setup, Theme module, High contrast state management)
3. **Focus Management & Navigation**: (FocusManager, KeyboardNavigator)
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: (Core system)
5. **Hint System**: (Core logic, Display component)
6. **Color System Integration**: (Initial setup: `ColorSystem` module created, `Theme` refactored for variant palettes, `ThemeIntegration` refactored)
7. **User Preferences System**: (Initial setup: `UserPreferences` GenServer refactored, `Persistence` module created, auto-saving implemented)
8. **Documentation & Examples**: (Ongoing)
9. **Component Refactoring**: (Multiple core components updated to use `Base.Component`)
10. **Layout Engine:** (Measurement logic for core elements implemented)
11. **Sixel Graphics:** (Parsing logic refactored, basic rendering structure implemented)
12. **Dashboard Component:** (Grid layout rendering implemented)

## What I Need Help With Next

I'd like you to focus on the following areas:

1. **Color System Integration**:

   - Update components to use `ColorSystem.get/1`.
   - Refine theme definitions (dark, light, default) and palettes.
   - Test high-contrast mode thoroughly across components.

2. **Animation System Enhancements**:

   - Expand the animation capabilities in the `FocusRing` component.
   - Build a general-purpose animation framework that respects reduced motion settings.
   - Implement smooth transitions between UI states.
   - Create standardized animation patterns for common interactions.

3. **User Preferences System**:

   - Integrate `UserPreferences` loading/saving into core modules (`Accessibility`, `Theme`, Application startup).
   - Add preference UI components.
   - Ensure preferences are applied consistently across components.

4. **Internationalization Framework**:

   - Lay groundwork for i18n support.
   - Integrate with accessibility features.
   - Support right-to-left languages.
   - Handle screen reader announcements in multiple languages.

5. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Create specialized test helpers for accessibility testing.
   - Implement automated tests for WCAG compliance where applicable.
   - Add performance testing for animation and rendering.
   - Enhance tests for `MultiLineInput`, `SixelGraphics`, `Dashboard`, `ColorSystem`, `UserPreferences`.

## Codebase Information

- The core UX framework is in `lib/raxol/core/`
- Components are in `lib/raxol/components/`
- Examples are in `lib/raxol/examples/`
- Tests are in `test/raxol/`
- Documentation is in `docs/`

The most important modules to understand:

- `Raxol.Core.UXRefinement`: Central module that ties everything together
- `Raxol.Core.Accessibility`: Core accessibility features
- `Raxol.Core.Accessibility.ThemeIntegration`: Connects accessibility with themes
- `Raxol.Core.KeyboardShortcuts`: Manages keyboard shortcuts
- `Raxol.Core.FocusManager`: Handles focus state and navigation

## Development Approach

I've been focusing on:

- Comprehensive documentation
- Thorough test coverage
- Modular, extensible design
- Consistent API patterns
- Accessibility as a core feature, not an afterthought

Please maintain this approach as you continue development. All new features should be well-documented, thoroughly tested, and accessible by default.

Thank you for taking over this project! I'm excited to see how you enhance these UX refinement features.

# Handoff: Raxol Runtime Implementation & Rendering Pipeline

**Context:**

Continuing the effort to implement the core Raxol runtime based on the Application/TEA pattern and fix the rendering pipeline. Previous work involved refactoring `lib/raxol/terminal/configuration.ex` and reducing compiler warnings.

**Progress Made:** (Content moved to CHANGELOG.md)

**Remaining Warning Categories (Summary):**

Compiler warnings should be significantly reduced. A `mix compile --force | cat` should be run to verify. Potential remaining warnings might be related to unimplemented parts or `TODO`s.

**Implementation TODOs:** (Content moved to CHANGELOG.md or Next Steps)

**Status:** Core runtime components are largely functional. Plugin lifecycle and command handling implemented and tested. The core View/Layout/Rendering pipeline has been partially verified and refactored for consistency. **Component refactoring is in progress:** Several core components have been updated to use the standard `Raxol.UI.Components.Base.Component` behaviour and `Raxol.View.Elements` macros. Placeholder measurement logic was replaced with actual logic in `LayoutEngine.measure_element/2` for `:panel`, `:grid`, and `:view`. **Numerous compiler warnings have been fixed, and the project compiles cleanly with `--warnings-as-errors`.**

**Recent Activity:**

- Fixed initial compilation errors in `MultiLineInput`, `LayoutEngine`, `FocusRing`.
- Fixed widget components (`info_widget`, `text_input_widget`) to use `Base.Component` instead of obsolete `Dashboard.Widget`.
- Fixed cyclic dependency in `Spinner` by changing `Event` struct match to map match.
- **Refactored multiple components** (`Table`, `Progress`, `SingleLineInput`, `ProgressBar`, `List`, `FocusRing`, `Dropdown`, `Modal`, `HintDisplay`, `Terminal`) to implement the standard `Component` behaviour (`init/1`, `update/2`, `handle_event/3`, `render/2`) and use `Raxol.View.Elements` macros instead of legacy `Layout` or `View` functions.
- Removed various unused aliases and functions identified during compilation.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Identified and resolved persistent syntax error in `SingleLineInput` caused by using `after` (reserved keyword) as a variable name within an `if` block.**
- Fixed syntax error in `ux_refinement_demo.ex` related to conditional rendering of `FocusRing`.
- **Implemented placeholder measurement logic in `Raxol.UI.Layout.Engine.measure_element/2` by removing duplicate clauses and fixing structure.**
- **Fixed numerous compiler warnings related to unused aliases, imports, variables, macro usage, and function definitions.**
- **Added placeholder `get_hints_for/1` in `ux_refinement_demo.ex`.**
- **Fixed duplicate `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Application` behaviour declaration warning in `lib/raxol/examples/ux_refinement_demo.ex`.**
- **Solidified Layout Measurement:** Implemented measurement logic for `:panel`, `:grid`, and `:view` in `LayoutEngine`, replacing placeholders. Added tests for `:box`, `:checkbox`, `:panel`, and `:grid` measurement.
- **Refactored Terminal Parser:** Extracted state-specific logic (`handle_<state>_state` functions) and CSI dispatch logic (`dispatch_csi_*` functions) from main loops.
- **Refactored MultiLineInput:** Extracted core logic for text manipulation, navigation, rendering, event handling, and clipboard operations into helper modules (`TextHelper`, `NavigationHelper`, `RenderHelper`, `EventHandler`, `ClipboardHelper`) within `lib/raxol/components/input/multi_line_input/`.
- **Implemented MultiLineInput Features:** Added basic cursor navigation (arrows, line/doc start/end, page up/down, word left/right), clipboard integration (copy/cut/paste via commands), and scroll offset adjustment logic (`handle_scroll`, `ensure_cursor_visible`).
- **Enhanced UX Demo:** Updated `ux_refinement_demo.ex` to dynamically fetch hints based on focus and render the `HintDisplay` component.
- **Implemented Parser Placeholders:** Filled in logic for `handle_sgr`, `handle_set_scroll_region`, `handle_cursor_style`, and `handle_device_status_report` in `lib/raxol/terminal/parser.ex`.
- **Enhanced MultiLineInput Testing:** Added basic test suites for `TextHelper`, `NavigationHelper`, `RenderHelper`, `EventHandler`, and `ClipboardHelper`.
- **Implemented MultiLineInput Selection:** Added logic to handle Shift+Movement keys for text selection in `EventHandler` and `MultiLineInput`.
- **Refactored VisualizationPlugin:** Extracted rendering logic into `ChartRenderer`, `TreemapRenderer`, `ImageRenderer` and shared helpers into `DrawingUtils`. Updated plugin to use `handle_placeholder` hook.
- **Refactored Terminal Emulator:** Moved C0/simple ESC handlers to `ControlCodes`. Extracted autowrap logic into a helper function.
- **Refactored Terminal Integration:** Extracted memory management (`MemoryManager`) and config update helpers (`Config.Utils`, used via `Config.merge_opts`) from `Integration.ex`.
- **Partially Refactored Sixel Graphics:** Extracted pattern mapping (`SixelPatternMap`) and palette logic (`SixelPalette`). Sketched stateful parser (`ParserState`, `parse_sixel_data`) and implemented parameter parsing for core commands.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Integrate User Preferences**: Update `Accessibility`, `Theme`, and Application startup to load initial state from and save changes to `UserPreferences`.
2. **Sixel Rendering**: Implement Run-Length Encoding (RLE) optimization in `SixelGraphics.generate_pixel_data/4`.
3. **Refactor Remaining Large Modules**: Systematically review/split other large files identified in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
4. **Continue Core UX Features**: Proceed with Animation System or i18n Framework implementation.
5. **Enhance Component Tests**: Improve test coverage, especially edge cases and interactions for `MultiLineInput` and accessibility/preference features.
6. **Implement Remaining Placeholders**: Address TODOs in `MultiLineInput` (mouse drag, word movement refinements) and Sixel rendering.
