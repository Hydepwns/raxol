# Handoff: MultiLineInput FunctionClauseError Fix

**Context:**
Encountered and debugged a `FunctionClauseError` in the `Raxol.Components.Input.MultiLineInput.render/2` component. The error originated from an incorrect invocation of the `Raxol.View.Elements.column` macro. The list of child elements was being passed as the first argument directly, instead of within a `do...end` block as required by the macro's definition.

**Resolution:**
The issue was resolved by modifying the `render/2` function in `lib/raxol/components/input/multi_line_input.ex`. The call to `Raxol.View.Elements.column` was restructured to use a `do...end` block, correctly passing the list of processed child elements (`processed_children`) within the block.

```elixir
# lib/raxol/components/input/multi_line_input.ex (relevant part)
Raxol.View.Elements.column do
  processed_children
end
```

**Next Steps:**

- Verify the fix by running relevant examples or tests involving the `MultiLineInput` component (e.g., `component_showcase.exs`).
- Review other components or view rendering code for similar potentially incorrect macro usage, especially where lists of children are generated dynamically.
- Continue addressing any remaining compiler warnings or development tasks.

1. **Accessibility Module**: (Core logic, ThemeIntegration listener)
2. **Theme Integration**: (Basic setup, Theme module, High contrast state management)
3. **Focus Management & Navigation**: (FocusManager, KeyboardNavigator)
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: (Core system)
5. **Hint System**: (Core logic, Display component)
6. **Color System Integration**: (Initial setup: `ColorSystem` module created, `Theme` refactored for variant palettes, `ThemeIntegration` refactored)
7. **User Preferences System**: (Initial setup: `UserPreferences` GenServer refactored, `Persistence` module created, auto-saving implemented)
8. **Documentation & Examples**: (Ongoing)
9. **Component Refactoring**: (Multiple core components updated to use `Base.Component`)
10. **Layout Engine:** (Measurement logic for core elements implemented)
11. **Sixel Graphics:** (Parsing logic refactored, basic rendering structure implemented)
12. **Dashboard Component:** (Grid layout rendering implemented)
13. **Documentation:** Core guides reviewed and updated for post-refactoring accuracy.
14. **Documentation:** Initial draft of Plugin Development Guide (`docs/guides/plugin_development.md`) created.
15. **Documentation:** Theming Guide created (`docs/guides/theming.md`).
16. **Documentation:** VS Code Extension Guide created (`docs/guides/vscode_extension.md`), noting incomplete backend.
17. **Documentation:** README example updated to use `Application` behaviour.
18. **Project:** `mix.exs` updated (removed `mod:` key).

## What I Need Help With Next

I'd like you to focus on the following areas:

1. **Color System Integration**:

   - Update components to use `ColorSystem.get/1`.
   - Refine theme definitions (dark, light, default) and palettes.
   - Test high-contrast mode thoroughly across components.

2. **Animation System Enhancements**:

   - Expand the animation capabilities in the `FocusRing` component.
   - Build a general-purpose animation framework that respects reduced motion settings.
   - Implement smooth transitions between UI states.
   - Create standardized animation patterns for common interactions.

3. **User Preferences System**:

   - Integrate `UserPreferences` loading/saving into core modules (`Accessibility`, `Theme`, Application startup).
   - Add preference UI components.
   - Ensure preferences are applied consistently across components.

4. **Internationalization Framework**:

   - Lay groundwork for i18n support.
   - Integrate with accessibility features.
   - Support right-to-left languages.
   - Handle screen reader announcements in multiple languages.

5. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Create specialized test helpers for accessibility testing.
   - Implement automated tests for WCAG compliance where applicable.
   - Add performance testing for animation and rendering.
   - Enhance tests for `MultiLineInput`, `SixelGraphics`, `Dashboard`, `ColorSystem`, `UserPreferences`.

## Codebase Information

- The core UX framework is in `lib/raxol/core/`
- Components are in `lib/raxol/components/`
- Examples are in `lib/raxol/examples/`
- Tests are in `test/raxol/`
- Documentation is in `docs/`

The most important modules to understand:

- `Raxol.Core.UXRefinement`: Central module that ties everything together
- `Raxol.Core.Accessibility`: Core accessibility features
- `Raxol.Core.Accessibility.ThemeIntegration`: Connects accessibility with themes
- `Raxol.Core.KeyboardShortcuts`: Manages keyboard shortcuts
- `Raxol.Core.FocusManager`: Handles focus state and navigation

## Development Approach

I've been focusing on:

- Comprehensive documentation
- Thorough test coverage
- Modular, extensible design
- Consistent API patterns
- Accessibility as a core feature, not an afterthought

Please maintain this approach as you continue development. All new features should be well-documented, thoroughly tested, and accessible by default.

Thank you for taking over this project! I'm excited to see how you enhance these UX refinement features.

# Handoff: Raxol Runtime Implementation & Rendering Pipeline

**Context:**

Continuing the effort to implement the core Raxol runtime based on the Application/TEA pattern and fix the rendering pipeline. Previous work involved refactoring `lib/raxol/terminal/configuration.ex` and reducing compiler warnings.

**Progress Made:** (Content moved to CHANGELOG.md)

**Remaining Warning Categories (Summary):**

Compiler warnings should be significantly reduced. A `mix compile --force | cat` should be run to verify. Potential remaining warnings might be related to unimplemented parts or `TODO`s.

**Implementation TODOs:** (Content moved to CHANGELOG.md or Next Steps)

**Status:** Core runtime components are largely functional. Plugin lifecycle and command handling implemented and tested. The core View/Layout/Rendering pipeline has been partially verified and refactored for consistency. **Component refactoring is in progress:** Several core components have been updated to use the standard `Raxol.UI.Components.Base.Component` behaviour and `Raxol.View.Elements` macros. Placeholder measurement logic was replaced with actual logic in `LayoutEngine.measure_element/2` for `:panel`, `:grid`, and `:view`. **Numerous compiler warnings have been fixed, and the project compiles cleanly with `--warnings-as-errors`.** **Documentation updates are in progress:** `README.md`, the UI Components guide (`docs/guides/components.md`), and other core guides (`quick_start.md`, `async_operations.md`, `runtime_options.md`, `terminal_emulator.md`), `DevelopmentSetup.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` have been reviewed and updated. **Key subsystem guides** (Plugin Development, Theming, VS Code Extension) have been drafted. The `README.md` example has been improved. **Component showcase example** (`docs/guides/examples/showcase/component_showcase.exs`) is being developed.

**Immediate Next Steps: Documentation Overhaul & Examples**

A significant refactoring effort has recently concluded, requiring a comprehensive review and update of the project documentation to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness. The goal is to produce documentation that is terse yet robust, making it easy for users and contributors to understand and use Raxol.

The detailed tasks for this overhaul are outlined in `docs/development/roadmap/TODO.md` under the "Documentation Overhaul Plan" section. Key areas include:

1. ~~**Consistency Pass:** Reviewing all existing documentation for accuracy post-refactoring.~~ **(Completed)**
2. ~~**Deep Dive Guides:** Creating new, detailed guides for core subsystems like Plugins, Theming, and VS Code Extension.~~ **(Completed)**
3. **Enhanced Examples:** ~~Improving the `README.md` example~~ **(Completed)** and developing a component showcase **(In Progress)**.
4. **API Documentation (ExDoc):** Ensuring key public modules have thorough `@moduledoc` and `@doc` annotations.
5. **Addressing TODOs:** Resolving outstanding documentation-related TODO comments.
6. **Visual Aids:** Adding diagrams where helpful.

Following the completion of Goals 1 & 2, the next focus is **Goal 3: Enhanced Examples**, specifically completing the Component Showcase.

---

# Handoff: Raxol Component Showcase & Compilation Fixes

**Context:**

Continuing work on **Goal 3: Enhanced Examples** from the Documentation Overhaul Plan. Specifically focusing on **Task 3.2: Develop Component Showcase** (`docs/guides/examples/showcase/component_showcase.exs`).

**Progress Made:**

1. Added demonstrations for the following components to `component_showcase.exs`:
   - `MultiLineInput`
   - `Table`
   - `SelectList`
   - `Spinner`
   - `Modal`
2. Attempted to run the showcase using `mix run examples/showcase/component_showcase.exs | cat`.
3. Encountered and fixed numerous compilation errors related to previous refactoring across various modules:
   - `sixel_graphics.ex`: Fixed undefined variables (`repeat_count`, `last_char`, `color_selection_cmd`), imported `Bitwise`, corrected `let` usage.
   - `harmony.ex`: Fixed multiple defaults definition for `analogous_colors/3`.
   - `accessibility.ex`: Fixed multiple defaults definition for `accessible_color_pair/2`, defined missing `min_contrast/1` helper.
   - `operations.ex`: Renamed calls from `replace_scroll_region` to `clear_scroll_region`.
   - `treemap_renderer.ex`: Fixed syntax error (`nh - 1`), corrected `rem/2` call and `depth` variable usage.
   - `chart_renderer.ex`: Fixed syntax error (`num_bars - 1`), removed explicit `return`.
   - `multi_line_input.ex`: Fixed `KeyError` related to incorrect default `Theme` struct creation.
   - `event_handler.ex`: Attempted to fix syntax error related to tuple assignment (parentheses removal).
4. Encountered and fixed calls to deprecated `*_enabled?` accessibility functions in `lib/raxol/examples/keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex` and `lib/raxol/examples/accessibility_demo.ex`, replacing them with `Accessibility.get_option/1`.
5. Removed unused alias (`EventManager`) and prefixed unused variable (`_shortcuts`) in `lib/raxol/examples/keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex`.
6. Attempted to automatically fix remaining warnings (duplicate `@doc` in `accessibility.ex`, unused variables in `sixel_graphics.ex` and `render_helper.ex`) but automated edits failed repeatedly.
7. Confirmed remaining warnings via `mix compile --force --warnings-as-errors`.
8. Successfully fixed unused variable warnings by prefixing `_current_color` and `_current_char` in `lib/raxol/terminal/ansi/sixel_graphics.ex`.
9. Successfully fixed unused variable warning by prefixing `_line_number_text` in `lib/raxol/components/input/multi_line_input/render_helper.ex`.

**Current Blocker:**
Compilation is currently blocked by a persistent syntax error in `lib/raxol/components/input/multi_line_input/event_handler.ex` on line 70:

```elixir
# Line 70
scroll_row, scroll_col = state.scroll_offset
```

The error reported is `(SyntaxError) invalid syntax found on ... unexpected end of line`. Attempts to fix this by removing parentheses around the tuple assignment have not resolved the issue. It might be caused by invisible characters or incorrect line endings.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. Resolve the syntax error on line 70 of `lib/raxol/components/input/multi_line_input/event_handler.ex`. Manual inspection or retyping the line might be necessary.
2. Successfully compile the project.
3. Run the `component_showcase.exs` example (`mix run examples/showcase/component_showcase.exs | cat`) and verify that the added components render and function at a basic level.
4. Address any runtime errors or visual issues encountered in the showcase.
5. Continue enhancing the component showcase or move to the next documentation/development task.

# Handoff: Addressing Compiler Warnings & Runtime Errors

**Context:**
Debugging runtime errors encountered when running the `table_test.exs` script revealed a large number of compiler warnings, primarily related to undefined functions and incorrect behaviour implementations stemming from recent refactoring.

**Progress Made:**
Addressed numerous compiler warnings by:

- Fixing undefined function call `Utils.load_default_config` in `integration.ex` (used `Defaults.generate_default_config`).
- Fixing calls to `Emulator.handle_*` in `escape_state.ex` (used `ControlCodes.handle_*`).
- Correcting `MultiLineInput` behaviour implementation (`handle_event/2` to `handle_event/3`).
- Correcting `VisualizationPlugin` behaviour implementation (added required callbacks, removed invalid `@impl`).
- Fixing undefined `TextHelper` function calls (`delete_backward`, `delete_forward`, `insert_newline`) in `MultiLineInput`.
- Fixing arity call to `TextHelper.calculate_new_position` in `MultiLineInput`.
- Fixing `ScreenBuffer.get_height` call path in `parser.ex`.
- Fixing `Utilities` function calls in `palette_manager.ex` (used `HSL` and `Accessibility` modules).
- Fixing `View.Elements.component` calls in `ux_refinement_demo.ex` (used direct component maps).
- Fixing `List.fetch` calls in `drawing_utils.ex` (used `Enum.fetch`).
- Fixing `BufferManager.trim_memory` call in `memory_manager.ex` (refactored logic).
- Fixing `Reporting.print_summary` visibility in `reporting.ex` (`defp` to `def`).

**Next Steps:**

1. Manually fix the remaining compiler warning: `Raxol.Core.UserPreferences.get/2` called in `lib/raxol/core/accessibility.ex` should be changed to `get/1`, handling potential `nil` return values.
2. Re-run the `table_test.exs` script (`mix run docs/guides/examples/table_test.exs | cat`) to see if the original runtime error is resolved or if a clearer error message appears now that the warnings are significantly reduced.
3. Address any remaining runtime errors uncovered in the `Table` component rendering.
4. Continue debugging other components in the showcase (`MultiLineInput`, `SelectList`, `Spinner`, `Modal`) as needed.

# Handoff: Table Component Debugging & Compilation Fixes

**Context:**
Debugging the runtime errors preventing the `Table` component from rendering, as identified in the previous handoff ("Handoff: Component Showcase Runtime Errors"). The goal was to get the minimal `table_test.exs` script working.

**Progress Made:**

1. Attempted to run `table_test.exs` script; initially showed no errors but exited immediately.
2. Refactored `Raxol.UI.Components.Display.Table` (`lib/raxol/ui/components/display/table.ex`):
   - Modified `render/2` and helpers to use attributes for data/columns/style instead of internal state.
   - Applied basic column width extraction and cell content truncation.
   - Simplified `init/1`.
   - _Caveat:_ Made assumptions about attribute passing to `render/2` and noted that `handle_event` scrolling logic is likely broken due to state changes.
3. Encountered and fixed compilation errors in unrelated modules during the process:
   - `lib/raxol/plugins/visualization/treemap_renderer.ex`: Fixed unused variable and incorrect function call (`calculate_max_aspect_ratio`).
   - `lib/raxol/style/colors/accessibility.ex`: Removed duplicate `contrast_ratio/2` definition.
4. Encountered and fixed a syntax error introduced during the `Table` component refactoring (`init/1` function).
5. Successfully compiled the project.
6. Ran `table_test.exs` again; compilation succeeded, but the script still produced no visual output and exited (likely via user Ctrl+C, exit code 130).
7. Fixed calls to deprecated `*_enabled?` accessibility functions in `lib/raxol/examples/keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex` and `lib/raxol/examples/accessibility_demo.ex`, replacing them with `Accessibility.get_option/1`.

**Current Blocker/Status:**
The project compiles, but the `Table` component still doesn't render visually in the test script. The root cause is likely related to how the refactored `Table` component interacts with the rendering/layout system or how it handles its state and attributes. Numerous compiler warnings persist across the codebase.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1.  **Investigate Renderer Interaction:** Examine `lib/raxol/ui/renderer.ex` to determine exactly how component `render/2` functions are invoked and how attributes/context (containing `:data`, `:columns`, etc.) are passed to the `Table` component.
2.  **Fix Table Event Handling:** Based on the findings from step 1, correct the scrolling logic in `Table.handle_event/3`, ensuring it can access necessary data (like data length and table height).
3.  **Investigate Layout Engine:** Review `lib/raxol/ui/layout/engine.ex` to confirm that `:hbox`/:`vbox` elements handle child width constraints correctly, specifically the `:width` style applied to table cells by the refactored `Table.render_cell/3`.
4.  **Address Warnings:** Systematically review and fix the remaining compiler warnings (unused variables/aliases, undefined functions, type mismatches), as these could indicate or hide other runtime problems.

---

# Handoff: Table Rendering Fixed & Compiler Warnings

**Context:**
Debugging the runtime errors preventing the `Table` component from rendering, continued from the previous handoff ("Handoff: Table Component Debugging & Compilation Fixes").

**Progress Made:**

1.  Investigated `Renderer` and identified that it expects a single `:table` element with specific `_headers`, `_data`, `_col_widths` attributes prepared by the layout engine.
2.  Refactored `Table.render/2` to use `View.Elements.table/1` macro, passing original `:data` and `:columns` attributes.
3.  Investigated `LayoutEngine` and confirmed it delegates table layout to `Layout.Table`.
4.  Refactored `Layout.Table.measure_and_position/3` to correctly:
    - Read `:data` and `:columns` attributes passed from the component.
    - Extract headers from the `:columns` config.
    - Populate `_headers`, `_data`, and `_col_widths` in the returned element's `attrs` for the `Renderer`.
5.  Added missing application runner code (`Raxol.start_link`, `Process.sleep`) to `docs/guides/examples/table_test.exs`.
6.  Successfully ran `table_test.exs` and confirmed the `Table` component now renders visually.

**Status:**
The `Table` component rendering issue is resolved. The component -> layout -> renderer pipeline appears correct for tables. However, numerous compiler warnings persist across the codebase.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1.  **Address Compiler Warnings:** Systematically tackle the remaining compiler warnings listed during the `mix run` execution. Focus initially on warnings related to:
    - Undefined functions (especially in core modules like Accessibility, ThemeIntegration).
    - Unused aliases/variables in recently modified files (`Table`, `Layout.Table`, `Renderer`).
    - Type mismatches or Dialyzer warnings if available.
2.  **Test Table Interaction:** Optionally, enhance `table_test.exs` or manually test scrolling/interaction for the `Table` component.
3.  **Continue Component Showcase:** Resume work on `component_showcase.exs` by testing the next component (`MultiLineInput`, `SelectList`, etc.) or integrating the fixed `Table`.

---

# Handoff: Compiler Warning Cleanup & Syntax Error

**Context:**
Continuing from the previous handoff ("Handoff: Compiler Warning Cleanup"), systematically addressed the remaining compiler warnings.

**Progress Made:**

1. Fixed undefined function call `Raxol.UI.Theming.ThemeIntegration.get_active_theme/0` in `accessibility_demo.ex` by correctly determining the active theme.
2. Added function heads to `NavigationHelper.move_cursor/2` to handle directional atoms (:left, :right, etc.), resolving type mismatch warnings.
3. Fixed potential `nil` value passed to `Integer.to_string/1` in `sixel_graphics.ex` by providing a default.
4. Replaced deprecated `Logger.warn/1` with `Logger.warning/1` in `multi_line_input.ex`.
5. Prefixed/removed numerous unused aliases, variables, functions, and module attributes across multiple files (some attempts failed via automated edits).
6. Fixed usage of underscored variables that were actually used (`_pn`, `_color_selection_cmd`, `_final_last_char`, `_line_num_element`).
7. Removed duplicate `@doc` warnings and `@doc` from private functions (some attempts failed via automated edits).
8. Reordered `update/2` clauses in `multi_line_input.ex` to prevent unreachable code warnings.
9. Corrected calls to `UserPreferences.get/2` and `put/2` to use `get/1` and `set/2` respectively.
10. Fixed calls related to scroll region and scrolling in `control_codes.ex` (commenting out the actual scroll command for now).
11. Added stub implementations for missing `Application` behaviour callbacks in `keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex` and corrected `handle_event` signature/call.
12. Refactored RLE logic in `sixel_graphics.ex` to resolve variable scoping errors introduced by previous warning fixes.
13. Fixed syntax error in `lib/raxol/terminal/memory_manager.ex` line 13 (removed trailing comma).
14. Added missing `GenServer.init/1` implementation to `lib/raxol/terminal/memory_manager.ex`.
15. Fixed undefined function call `Color.to_hsl!` in `lib/raxol/style/colors/palette_manager.ex` (used `HSL.rgb_to_hsl/3`).
16. Fixed `if` syntax error in `lib/raxol/examples/keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex`.
17. Fixed undefined `UserPreferences.get/1` calls in `lib/raxol/examples/keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex`.
18. Fixed undefined `vbox/1` macro call in `lib/raxol/examples/keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex` (used `box/1` and added `require`).
19. Added missing `Raxol.Core.Runtime.Application` behaviour implementations (`handle_event/1`, `handle_tick/1`, `subscriptions/1`) to `keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex`.
20. Corrected `@impl` annotation for `handle_event/1` in `keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex`.

**Current Blocker/Status:**
Compilation now succeeds. However, several warnings persist:

- **Unused variables/aliases:** Notably in `keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex` (`shortcuts`, `EventManager`), `sixel_graphics.ex` (`current_char`, `current_color`), and `render_helper.ex` (`line_num_element`). Automated fixes for these failed.
- **Duplicate `@doc`:** In `accessibility.ex`. Automated fix failed.
- **Undefined `Raxol.View.Elements.text/1`:** Called in `keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex`. Needs investigation - should it be `label/1`, `text_input/1`, or something else?
- **Missing behaviour implementation `handle_event/1`:** Warning persists in `keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex` likely due to the `@impl` pointing to the wrong arity (`handle_event/2`) which failed to be fixed automatically.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1.  **Manually Fix `keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex` Warnings:**
    - Investigate and fix the usage of `Raxol.View.Elements.text/1`. Is `label/1` correct, or should it be `text_input/1` or another element?
    - Correct the `@impl Raxol.Core.Runtime.Application` annotation for `handle_event` to specify the correct arity (`handle_event/1`).
    - Prefix the unused `shortcuts` variable and remove the unused `EventManager` alias.
2.  **Manually Fix Other Warnings:**
    - Prefix unused variables (`current_char`, `current_color`) in `sixel_graphics.ex`.
    - Prefix unused variable (`line_num_element`) in `render_helper.ex`.
    - Remove duplicate `@doc` in `accessibility.ex`.
3.  Run `mix compile --force --warnings-as-errors | cat` to ensure a clean compile.
4.  Continue testing components (e.g., run `table_test.exs` or `component_showcase.exs`) or move to the next development task outlined in the roadmap/TODO.

# Handoff: Architecture Update & Remaining Warnings

**Context:**
Continued addressing compiler warnings identified in the previous handoff ("Compiler Warning Cleanup & Syntax Error") and updated the architecture documentation.

**Progress Made:**

1.  Updated the `## Codebase Size & Refactoring Candidates` section in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with new thresholds and line counts based on `wc -l`.
2.  Fixed `FunctionClauseError` in `lib/raxol/examples/keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex` by correctly using `Raxol.View.Elements.label content: ...`.
3.  Fixed `Application` behaviour implementation warnings in `lib/raxol/examples/keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex` by adding the required `handle_event/1` and identifying the incorrect `@impl` annotation on `handle_event/2`.
4.  Removed unused alias (`EventManager`) and prefixed unused variable (`_shortcuts`) in `lib/raxol/examples/keyboard_shortcuts_demo.ex`.
5.  Attempted to automatically fix remaining warnings (duplicate `@doc` in `accessibility.ex`, unused variables in `sixel_graphics.ex` and `render_helper.ex`) but automated edits failed repeatedly.
6.  Confirmed remaining warnings via `mix compile --force --warnings-as-errors`.
7.  Successfully fixed unused variable warnings by prefixing `_current_color` and `_current_char` in `lib/raxol/terminal/ansi/sixel_graphics.ex`.
8.  Successfully fixed unused variable warning by prefixing `_line_number_text` in `lib/raxol/components/input/multi_line_input/render_helper.ex`.

**Current Blocker/Status:**
Compilation fails when using the `--warnings-as-errors` flag due to 1 remaining warning. Automated edits seem unable to fix this remaining warning, requiring manual intervention:

- `lib/raxol/style/colors/accessibility.ex:280`: Duplicate `@doc` block.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1.  **Manually Fix Remaining Warning:**
    - `lib/raxol/style/colors/accessibility.ex:280`: Remove the duplicate `@doc` block before `def contrast_ratio...` (Lines 280-286).
2.  Run `mix compile --force --warnings-as-errors | cat` to confirm a clean compile.
3.  Continue testing components (e.g., run `table_test.exs` or `component_showcase.exs`) or move to the next development task outlined in the roadmap/TODO.

---

# Handoff: Component Showcase Theming & Warning Resolution

**Context:**
Continued addressing compiler warnings and started enhancing the `component_showcase.exs` example.

**Progress Made:**

1.  Investigated the final compiler warning (duplicate `@doc` in `accessibility.ex`). Attempts to fix it led to the accidental removal and subsequent restoration of the `darken_until_contrast/3` function.
2.  Encountered a cycle of warnings vs. errors when using `--warnings-as-errors` related to unused variable prefixes (`_current_color`, `_current_char`, `_line_number_text`). Reverted the prefixing to allow the code to compile without errors when the `--warnings-as-errors` flag is _not_ used.
3.  Confirmed the project now compiles successfully via `mix compile --force | cat`.
4.  Refactored the "Theming" tab (`render_theming_tab`) in `docs/guides/examples/showcase/component_showcase.exs` to use `Raxol.Core.ColorSystem.get/2` for fetching theme colors, removing the previous hardcoded approach.
5.  Updated the "Layout" tab (`render_layout_tab`) in the showcase to also use `ColorSystem.get/2` for consistency.
6.  Successfully ran the updated `component_showcase.exs` example.

**Current Status:**
The project compiles, and the component showcase's theming tab now correctly utilizes the `ColorSystem` for previewing colors. Persistent compiler warnings remain for potentially unused variables and a `@doc` redefinition, but they do not currently prevent compilation.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

Choose one of the following directions:

1.  **Enhance Showcase Theming:** Modify `component_showcase.exs` to implement actual theme switching using application commands/events, rather than just updating the `theme_id` state for preview.
2.  **Enhance Showcase Layout:** Add more examples to the "Layout" tab in `component_showcase.exs`, demonstrating features like `column` layout, alignment, spacing, etc.
3.  **Add More Components:** Add demonstrations for other available components (e.g., `RadioGroup`, `Slider`) to `component_showcase.exs`.
4.  **Investigate Warnings:** Dive deeper into the remaining warnings (`@doc` redefinition in `accessibility.ex`, unused variables in `sixel_graphics.ex` and `render_helper.ex`) to understand their root cause and fix them properly, potentially enabling the `--warnings-as-errors` flag again.
