# Development Handoff: Raxol UX Refinement & Accessibility

I've been working on enhancing the Raxol framework with comprehensive UX refinement and accessibility features. Here's what I've accomplished so far and what I'd like you to help me with next.

## What's Been Completed

1. **Accessibility Module**: (Core logic, ThemeIntegration listener)
2. **Theme Integration**: (Basic setup, Theme module, High contrast state management)
3. **Focus Management & Navigation**: (FocusManager, KeyboardNavigator)
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: (Core system)
5. **Hint System**: (Core logic, Display component)
6. **Color System Integration**: (Initial setup: `ColorSystem` module created, `Theme` refactored for variant palettes, `ThemeIntegration` refactored)
7. **User Preferences System**: (Initial setup: `UserPreferences` GenServer refactored, `Persistence` module created, auto-saving implemented)
8. **Documentation & Examples**: (Ongoing)
9. **Component Refactoring**: (Multiple core components updated to use `Base.Component`)
10. **Layout Engine:** (Measurement logic for core elements implemented)
11. **Sixel Graphics:** (Parsing logic refactored, basic rendering structure implemented)
12. **Dashboard Component:** (Grid layout rendering implemented)
13. **Documentation:** Core guides reviewed and updated for post-refactoring accuracy.
14. **Documentation:** Initial draft of Plugin Development Guide (`docs/guides/plugin_development.md`) created.
15. **Documentation:** Theming Guide created (`docs/guides/theming.md`).
16. **Documentation:** VS Code Extension Guide created (`docs/guides/vscode_extension.md`), noting incomplete backend.
17. **Documentation:** README example updated to use `Application` behaviour.
18. **Project:** `mix.exs` updated (removed `mod:` key).

## What I Need Help With Next

I'd like you to focus on the following areas:

1. **Color System Integration**:

   - Update components to use `ColorSystem.get/1`.
   - Refine theme definitions (dark, light, default) and palettes.
   - Test high-contrast mode thoroughly across components.

2. **Animation System Enhancements**:

   - Expand the animation capabilities in the `FocusRing` component.
   - Build a general-purpose animation framework that respects reduced motion settings.
   - Implement smooth transitions between UI states.
   - Create standardized animation patterns for common interactions.

3. **User Preferences System**:

   - Integrate `UserPreferences` loading/saving into core modules (`Accessibility`, `Theme`, Application startup).
   - Add preference UI components.
   - Ensure preferences are applied consistently across components.

4. **Internationalization Framework**:

   - Lay groundwork for i18n support.
   - Integrate with accessibility features.
   - Support right-to-left languages.
   - Handle screen reader announcements in multiple languages.

5. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Create specialized test helpers for accessibility testing.
   - Implement automated tests for WCAG compliance where applicable.
   - Add performance testing for animation and rendering.
   - Enhance tests for `MultiLineInput`, `SixelGraphics`, `Dashboard`, `ColorSystem`, `UserPreferences`.

## Codebase Information

- The core UX framework is in `lib/raxol/core/`
- Components are in `lib/raxol/components/`
- Examples are in `lib/raxol/examples/`
- Tests are in `test/raxol/`
- Documentation is in `docs/`

The most important modules to understand:

- `Raxol.Core.UXRefinement`: Central module that ties everything together
- `Raxol.Core.Accessibility`: Core accessibility features
- `Raxol.Core.Accessibility.ThemeIntegration`: Connects accessibility with themes
- `Raxol.Core.KeyboardShortcuts`: Manages keyboard shortcuts
- `Raxol.Core.FocusManager`: Handles focus state and navigation

## Development Approach

I've been focusing on:

- Comprehensive documentation
- Thorough test coverage
- Modular, extensible design
- Consistent API patterns
- Accessibility as a core feature, not an afterthought

Please maintain this approach as you continue development. All new features should be well-documented, thoroughly tested, and accessible by default.

Thank you for taking over this project! I'm excited to see how you enhance these UX refinement features.

# Handoff: Raxol Runtime Implementation & Rendering Pipeline

**Context:**

Continuing the effort to implement the core Raxol runtime based on the Application/TEA pattern and fix the rendering pipeline. Previous work involved refactoring `lib/raxol/terminal/configuration.ex` and reducing compiler warnings.

**Progress Made:** (Content moved to CHANGELOG.md)

**Remaining Warning Categories (Summary):**

Compiler warnings should be significantly reduced. A `mix compile --force | cat` should be run to verify. Potential remaining warnings might be related to unimplemented parts or `TODO`s.

**Implementation TODOs:** (Content moved to CHANGELOG.md or Next Steps)

**Status:** Core runtime components are largely functional. Plugin lifecycle and command handling implemented and tested. The core View/Layout/Rendering pipeline has been partially verified and refactored for consistency. **Component refactoring is in progress:** Several core components have been updated to use the standard `Raxol.UI.Components.Base.Component` behaviour and `Raxol.View.Elements` macros. Placeholder measurement logic was replaced with actual logic in `LayoutEngine.measure_element/2` for `:panel`, `:grid`, and `:view`. **Numerous compiler warnings have been fixed, and the project compiles cleanly with `--warnings-as-errors`.** **Documentation updates are in progress:** `README.md`, the UI Components guide (`docs/guides/components.md`), and other core guides (`quick_start.md`, `async_operations.md`, `runtime_options.md`, `terminal_emulator.md`), `DevelopmentSetup.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` have been reviewed and updated. **Key subsystem guides** (Plugin Development, Theming, VS Code Extension) have been drafted. The `README.md` example has been improved. **Component showcase example** (`docs/guides/examples/showcase/component_showcase.exs`) is being developed.

**Immediate Next Steps: Documentation Overhaul & Examples**

A significant refactoring effort has recently concluded, requiring a comprehensive review and update of the project documentation to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness. The goal is to produce documentation that is terse yet robust, making it easy for users and contributors to understand and use Raxol.

The detailed tasks for this overhaul are outlined in `docs/development/roadmap/TODO.md` under the "Documentation Overhaul Plan" section. Key areas include:

1. ~~**Consistency Pass:** Reviewing all existing documentation for accuracy post-refactoring.~~ **(Completed)**
2. ~~**Deep Dive Guides:** Creating new, detailed guides for core subsystems like Plugins, Theming, and VS Code Extension.~~ **(Completed)**
3. **Enhanced Examples:** ~~Improving the `README.md` example~~ **(Completed)** and developing a component showcase **(In Progress)**.
4. **API Documentation (ExDoc):** Ensuring key public modules have thorough `@moduledoc` and `@doc` annotations.
5. **Addressing TODOs:** Resolving outstanding documentation-related TODO comments.
6. **Visual Aids:** Adding diagrams where helpful.

Following the completion of Goals 1 & 2, the next focus is **Goal 3: Enhanced Examples**, specifically completing the Component Showcase.

# Handoff: Raxol Component Showcase & Compilation Fixes

**Context:**

Continuing work on **Goal 3: Enhanced Examples** from the Documentation Overhaul Plan. Specifically focusing on **Task 3.2: Develop Component Showcase** (`docs/guides/examples/showcase/component_showcase.exs`).

**Progress Made:**

1. Added demonstrations for the following components to `component_showcase.exs`:
   - `MultiLineInput`
   - `Table`
   - `SelectList`
   - `Spinner`
   - `Modal`
2. Attempted to run the showcase using `mix run examples/showcase/component_showcase.exs | cat`.
3. Encountered and fixed numerous compilation errors related to previous refactoring across various modules:
   - `sixel_graphics.ex`: Fixed undefined variables (`repeat_count`, `last_char`, `color_selection_cmd`), imported `Bitwise`, corrected `let` usage.
   - `harmony.ex`: Fixed multiple defaults definition for `analogous_colors/3`.
   - `accessibility.ex`: Fixed multiple defaults definition for `accessible_color_pair/2`, defined missing `min_contrast/1` helper.
   - `operations.ex`: Renamed calls from `replace_scroll_region` to `clear_scroll_region`.
   - `treemap_renderer.ex`: Fixed syntax error (`nh - 1`), corrected `rem/2` call and `depth` variable usage.
   - `chart_renderer.ex`: Fixed syntax error (`num_bars - 1`), removed explicit `return`.
   - `multi_line_input.ex`: Fixed `KeyError` related to incorrect default `Theme` struct creation.
   - `event_handler.ex`: Attempted to fix syntax error related to tuple assignment (parentheses removal).

**Current Blocker:**

Compilation is currently blocked by a persistent syntax error in `lib/raxol/components/input/multi_line_input/event_handler.ex` on line 70:

```elixir
# Line 70
scroll_row, scroll_col = state.scroll_offset
```

The error reported is `(SyntaxError) invalid syntax found on ... unexpected end of line`. Attempts to fix this by removing parentheses around the tuple assignment have not resolved the issue. It might be caused by invisible characters or incorrect line endings.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. Resolve the syntax error on line 70 of `lib/raxol/components/input/multi_line_input/event_handler.ex`. Manual inspection or retyping the line might be necessary.
2. Successfully compile the project.
3. Run the `component_showcase.exs` example (`mix run examples/showcase/component_showcase.exs | cat`) and verify that the added components render and function at a basic level.
4. Address any runtime errors or visual issues encountered in the showcase.
5. Continue enhancing the component showcase or move to the next documentation/development task.
