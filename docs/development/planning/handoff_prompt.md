# Handoff: Example Investigation & Runtime Debugging

**Context:**
Previous steps involved documentation cleanup. Attempted to verify the status of examples in `lib/raxol/examples` after recent refactoring.

**Current Status:**
Investigation revealed that examples like `integrated_accessibility_demo.ex` contained standalone `run/0` functions using a separate `Raxol.UI.Terminal` module, bypassing the main Raxol runtime. This standalone logic was removed, and the `bin/demo.exs` runner was updated to use `Raxol.start_link/1`.

However, launching examples (`Form`, `IntegratedAccessibilityDemo`) via `Raxol.start_link/1` results in the application hanging after compilation, before any UI is rendered. This indicates a likely blocking issue within the core Raxol runtime startup sequence (e.g., Dispatcher, Rendering Engine, Terminal Driver initialization or interaction).

The project still compiles, but persistent compiler warnings remain.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

**Debug Core Runtime Hang:** The highest priority is to diagnose and fix the blocking issue preventing examples from running via `Raxol.start_link/1`. This will likely involve adding logging to core modules (`Core.Runtime.Dispatcher`, `Core.Runtime.Rendering.Engine`, `UI.Renderer`, `Terminal.Driver`) to trace the execution flow during startup and the initial render cycle.

Once the examples can successfully launch:

1. **Address Warnings:** Fix remaining compiler warnings.
2. **Refactor/Fix Examples:** Fully adapt the example modules (like `IntegratedAccessibilityDemo`) to the `Application` behaviour, implementing proper state management and view logic using `Raxol.View.Elements`.
3. **Enhance Component Showcase:** Resume work on `docs/guides/examples/showcase/component_showcase.exs`.
4. **Tackle Roadmap Items:** Consult `docs/development/planning/roadmap/Roadmap.md` or `TODO.md`.
