# Raxol Development Best Practices

Based on our recent work, we've established the following best practices for Raxol development:

## Component Testing Approach

- Create dedicated testing helpers per component type
- Implement mock components for integration testing
- Use stub implementations for visual testing
- Make testing helpers easily reusable
- Structure tests into logical units (unit, integration, visual)
- Implement comprehensive test coverage for all component states
- Ensure tests verify both appearance and behavior

## Component API Design

- Ensure consistent event handling patterns
- Support both disabled and active states
- Implement proper state transitions
- Provide style customization options
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Ensure proper theme integration
- Document component APIs thoroughly

## Layout and Grid Systems

- Support multiple naming conventions for better flexibility
- Implement proper validation and error handling
- Add detailed logging for debugging
- Use fallback values for missing configuration
- Ensure responsive behavior in different environments
- Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations
- Test layout systems with various widget sizes and configurations

## Performance Optimization

- Implement caching for expensive calculations
- Benchmark critical rendering paths
- Profile memory usage for large datasets
- Optimize render loops for efficiency
- Implement incremental updates when possible
- Minimize DOM operations in browser contexts
- Use efficient algorithms for data transformations

## Cross-platform Compatibility

- Test on multiple operating systems
- Implement platform-specific fallbacks
- Handle environment-specific initialization
- Use feature detection rather than platform detection
- Provide consistent error handling across platforms
- Document platform-specific limitations

## Code Organization

- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use consistent module organization
- Follow established naming conventions
- Keep related functionality together
- Create reusable utilities for common tasks
- Document module interfaces and responsibilities
- Use clear and descriptive variable/function names

## Development Workflow

- Verify changes in both VS Code and native terminal environments
- Run comprehensive test suites before submitting changes
- Use local CI testing with Act before pushing to GitHub
- Document significant changes in CHANGELOG.md
- Follow the established commit message format
- Create focused pull requests with clear descriptions
- Review code changes for consistency and quality
