# Unified Messaging Gateway

One daemon that connects many chat platforms through a shared contract. Each platform is an
adapter that owns only its own I/O and translation; routing, per-chat sessions, pairing,
authorization, and history all live in the gateway. A chat becomes an OTP process, so
platform fan-out is supervision rather than a single-process message queue.

The package (`raxol_gateway`, pre-alpha) depends on `raxol_core`, with `raxol_agent`
optional (used only to record turns to a durable conversation log). It has no auto-started
tree: you wire the supervisor yourself.

## The adapter contract

`Raxol.Gateway.Adapter` is the five-callback behaviour every platform implements:

| Callback | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `connect/1` | Open a platform connection, return a `conn` handle |
| `disconnect/1` | Close it |
| `platform/0` | The platform atom |
| `normalize_event/1` | Translate a raw platform event to `{:ok, Route.t(), event}` or `:ignore` |
| `send_message/3` | Send a rendered reply to a route |

The contract is frozen (ADR-0023): additions must be optional callbacks, and existing
callbacks do not change shape.

Shipping adapters:

| Adapter | Platform | Package |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.InMemory` | `:in_memory` (reference; sink pid) | raxol_gateway |
| `Raxol.Telegram.GatewayAdapter` | `:telegram` (text messages, chunked plain-text sends) | raxol_telegram |
| `Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Discord` | `:discord` (MESSAGE_CREATE text, chunked plain-text sends) | raxol_gateway |
| `Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email` | `:email` (bidirectional: SMTP send + RFC822 inbound; transport injected) | raxol_gateway |

A full Telegram wiring pairs the adapter with `Raxol.Telegram.UpdatePoller` (getUpdates
long polling) feeding `normalize_event/1` into the router:

```elixir
{:ok, conn} = Raxol.Telegram.GatewayAdapter.connect(bot_token: token)

Raxol.Gateway.Supervisor.start_link(
  handler: {Raxol.Gateway.Handler.Agent, [system_prompt: "..."]},
  adapter: {Raxol.Telegram.GatewayAdapter, conn}
)

Raxol.Telegram.UpdatePoller.start_link(
  conn: conn,
  on_update: fn raw ->
    # Authorize BEFORE routing: the adapter is a pure translator and checks
    # nothing, and Handler.Agent runs a paid backend call per text event.
    with {:ok, route, event} <- Raxol.Telegram.GatewayAdapter.normalize_event(raw),
         :allow <- Raxol.Gateway.Pairing.authorize(Raxol.Gateway.Pairing, route) do
      case Raxol.Gateway.SessionRouter.route(Raxol.Gateway.SessionRouter, route, event) do
        :ok -> :ok
        # Log rejects (rate limit, max sessions): the poller advances its
        # offset regardless, so a silent drop is permanent loss.
        {:error, reason} -> Logger.warning("update rejected: #{inspect(reason)}")
      end
    else
      :ignore -> :ok
      :deny -> :ok
    end
  end
)
```

The Discord wiring is the same shape with the roles renamed: the feed is
`Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Discord.GatewaySocket` (one Gateway v10 WebSocket with
client heartbeats, identify/resume, and exponential reconnect; requires the
optional `mint_web_socket` dependency), whose `:on_event` passes raw dispatch
frames through `Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Discord.normalize_event/1`. Replies go
out over REST (`POST /channels/:id/messages`, optional `req` dependency),
chunked at Discord's 2000 code points. Guild messages route as
`chat_type: :guild`, DMs as `:dm`; bot-authored messages never normalize, so
two agents cannot loop each other. Note the MESSAGE_CONTENT intent is
privileged: enable it in the Discord developer portal or guild message
content arrives empty.

```elixir
{:ok, conn} = Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Discord.connect(bot_token: token)

Raxol.Gateway.Supervisor.start_link(
  handler: {Raxol.Gateway.Handler.Agent, [system_prompt: "..."]},
  adapter: {Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Discord, conn}
)

Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Discord.GatewaySocket.start_link(
  token: token,
  on_event: fn frame ->
    with {:ok, route, event} <- Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Discord.normalize_event(frame),
         :allow <- Raxol.Gateway.Pairing.authorize(Raxol.Gateway.Pairing, route) do
      case Raxol.Gateway.SessionRouter.route(Raxol.Gateway.SessionRouter, route, event) do
        :ok -> :ok
        {:error, reason} -> Logger.warning("dispatch rejected: #{inspect(reason)}")
      end
    else
      :ignore -> :ok
      :deny -> :ok
    end
  end
)
```

## Agent-backed handler

`Raxol.Gateway.Handler.Agent` turns any chat into an agent conversation: each inbound
`%{text: text}` event runs one synchronous turn through `Raxol.Agent.Stream` and replies
with the collected answer. It requires the optional `raxol_agent` dependency.

```elixir
Raxol.Gateway.Supervisor.start_link(
  handler:
    {Raxol.Gateway.Handler.Agent,
     [
       system_prompt: "You are a helpful assistant.",
       # No backend pinned: auto_provider resolves credentials from the
       # environment (1Password ref -> provider env vars -> AI_API_KEY).
       agent_opts: []
     ]},
  adapter: {MyAdapter, conn}
)
```

Per-chat history is kept in the handler state (capped by `:max_history`, default 40
messages) and, when the session has a `:log`, also recorded to the conversation log. A
failed turn logs the full reason and replies with a short error message. Turns run
synchronously inside the per-chat session process, so set `:idle_timeout` comfortably
above the longest expected turn.

## TEA app handler

`Raxol.Gateway.Handler.Lifecycle` runs a full TEA app per chat under
`environment: :gateway` (a registered Lifecycle environment: no terminal driver, no
plugin manager, unnamed processes, so any number of chats can run the same app module
concurrently). Each inbound `%{text: t}` event becomes a Raxol event (char key or paste,
mirroring the Telegram input adapter), and the reply is the app's next rendered frame as
plain text. Requires the optional `raxol` dependency.

```elixir
Raxol.Gateway.Supervisor.start_link(
  handler: {Raxol.Gateway.Handler.Lifecycle, [app_module: MyTeaApp, width: 60, height: 16]},
  adapter: {MyAdapter, conn}
)
```

Turns are collected deterministically (event fold barrier, then a synchronous engine
render), and `:event_fn` / `:format_fn` are injectable for custom event mapping or frame
formatting. Frames the app renders between turns are discarded: a chat surface replies
to messages; spontaneous pushes are `Raxol.Gateway.Delivery`'s job. The handler's
`terminate/2` (a new optional `Handler` callback the session invokes on clean stops)
stops the per-chat Lifecycle so it cannot outlive its chat.

## Voice notes

`Raxol.Gateway.Pipeline.Transcribe` is a feed-loop stage that turns a voice media event
(`%{media: %{kind: :voice, ref: ..., ...}}`, what `Raxol.Telegram.GatewayAdapter` emits
for `message.voice` updates) into the ordinary `%{text: transcript}` event before it is
routed. It runs in the feed loop rather than the session so the conversation log records
the transcript (a session logs each inbound event before its handler runs) and so STT
never blocks a per-chat mailbox. Non-voice events pass through untouched.

```elixir
{:ok, conn} = Raxol.Telegram.GatewayAdapter.connect(bot_token: token)

Raxol.Telegram.UpdatePoller.start_link(
  conn: conn,
  on_update: fn raw ->
    with {:ok, route, event} <- Raxol.Telegram.GatewayAdapter.normalize_event(raw),
         :allow <- Raxol.Gateway.Pairing.authorize(Raxol.Gateway.Pairing, route),
         {:ok, event} <-
           Raxol.Gateway.Pipeline.Transcribe.run(event,
             fetch_fn: fn media -> Raxol.Telegram.GatewayAdapter.fetch_media(conn, media) end
           ) do
      case Raxol.Gateway.SessionRouter.route(Raxol.Gateway.SessionRouter, route, event) do
        :ok -> :ok
        # Log rejects: the poller advances its offset regardless, so a
        # silent drop is permanent loss.
        {:error, reason} -> Logger.warning("update rejected: #{inspect(reason)}")
      end
    else
      :ignore -> :ok
      :deny -> :ok
    end
  end
)
```

The three stages are injectable functions: `:fetch_fn` (platform download, here
`fetch_media/2` = Bot API `getFile` + file GET), `:convert_fn` (default: ffmpeg via a
temporary file, `-f f32le -ac 1 -ar 16000`, executable allowlisted), and `:recognize_fn`
(default: `Raxol.Speech.Recognizer.recognize/1` from the optional `raxol_speech`
dependency). The stage fails open per event: any failure (STT missing, download or
conversion error, empty transcript) drops that one voice note with a warning and
`[:raxol_gateway, :transcribe, :error]` telemetry; text traffic is never affected. Audio
bytes and transcripts stay out of the logs, as does the download URL (it embeds the bot
token).

Mind the cold start: the first recognition after boot pays the XLA graph compile, which
can take minutes on CPU. Give the Recognizer a generous `:recognize_timeout_ms` (via
`Raxol.Speech.Supervisor`'s `:recognizer_opts`) or warm it up front, otherwise every
cold call times out, aborts the compile, and the next call starts over.

## Routing and sessions

`Raxol.Gateway.Route` (`platform`, `chat_type`, `chat_id`, optional `user_id`) identifies a
chat. `Route.key/1` forms the stable session key:

```
agent:main:{platform}:{chat_type}:{chat_id}
```

`Raxol.Gateway.SessionRouter` (a `BaseManager` GenServer) starts one `Raxol.Gateway.Session`
process per chat under a `DynamicSupervisor`, keyed by that string, with an idle timeout
(default 10 minutes), a per-key start cooldown (default 5 seconds), and a max-session bound
(default 1000). Sessions run a `Raxol.Gateway.Handler` (`init/2` and `handle_event/2`,
plus an optional `terminate/2` invoked on clean session stops for handlers that own
linked processes). Each inbound event and each reply can be recorded to an optional log
keyed by a stable `conversation_id`.

## Pairing and authorization

`Raxol.Gateway.Pairing` issues 8-character DM pairing codes (from an unambiguous alphabet,
1-hour TTL, per-user request cooldown, global lockout after repeated failed confirms) and
decides `authorize/2` in this order:

1. the platform is configured to allow everyone, else
2. the user is paired, else
3. the user is in the platform allowlist, else
4. the user is in the global allowlist, else
5. deny.

## Delivery

`Raxol.Gateway.Delivery.deliver/3` resolves four outbound destinations:

- `{:direct, route}`: reply to the originating chat.
- `{:home, route}`: a configured home channel (cron or background results).
- `{:cross_platform, route}`: a different platform's chat.
- `{:target, "platform:chat_id"}`: an explicit target string. The platform is matched against
  connected adapters by string comparison, never turned into an atom from input.

### Email as a delivery target

`Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email` handles both directions. Outbound is what the
`{:home, route}` mode wants: cron and background results land in a mailbox with no
platform approval process. It needs the optional `gen_smtp` dependency, and
a route addresses a mailbox directly:

```elixir
{:ok, conn} =
  Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email.connect(
    relay: "smtp.example.com",
    port: 587,
    tls: :always,
    username: "bot@example.com",
    password: System.fetch_env!("SMTP_PASSWORD"),
    from: "bot@example.com",
    subject: "Nightly digest"
  )

route = Raxol.Gateway.Route.new(%{platform: :email, chat_type: :dm, chat_id: "ops@example.com"})
:ok = Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email.send_message(conn, route, rendered_report)
```

The rendered reply becomes a text/plain MIME message (utf-8, quoted-printable); nothing
is chunked, since email has no chat-style length limit.

### Email as a conversational surface

Inbound email makes an email thread a per-chat session like any other platform.
`normalize_event/1` parses a raw RFC822 message (`:mimemail.decode`, never raising) into
`{:ok, route, %{text: body}}`: it routes on the normalized sender address
(`chat_type: :dm`, `chat_id` lower-cased with the display name stripped), takes the first
`text/plain` part with quoted history trimmed, and surfaces `Message-ID`/`In-Reply-To`/
`References`/`Subject` under the event's `:email` key. Non-mail, unparseable, or
sender-less input returns `:ignore`.

The transport that pulls mail off a mailbox is injected, not bundled, because `gen_smtp`
only speaks SMTP and the mailbox a deployment reads (IMAP, POP3, the Gmail API, or an SMTP
listener) is its choice. `Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email.Inbox` is the sink-agnostic poll
feed (mirroring `Raxol.Telegram.UpdatePoller`): an injectable `:fetch_fn` cursor loop with
exponential backoff and credential-redacted status. `Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email.ThreadStore`
is a capped per-conversation store the wiring records inbound `Message-ID`s into and the
adapter reads back through `conn`'s `:thread_lookup`, so outbound replies set
`In-Reply-To`/`References`/`Re:` headers and mail clients keep the conversation together
(the frozen `send_message/3` has no per-send channel for the reply id).

```elixir
{:ok, store} = Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email.ThreadStore.start_link(name: MyThreads)

{:ok, conn} =
  Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email.connect(
    relay: "smtp.example.com",
    from: "bot@example.com",
    thread_lookup: Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email.ThreadStore.thread_lookup_fn(store)
  )

Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email.Inbox.start_link(
  fetch_fn: fn cursor -> MyMailbox.fetch_since(cursor) end,
  on_message: fn raw ->
    case Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email.normalize_event(raw) do
      {:ok, route, event} ->
        with :allow <- Raxol.Gateway.Pairing.authorize(MyPairing, route) do
          Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email.ThreadStore.record_event(store, route, event)
          Raxol.Gateway.SessionRouter.route(MyRouter, route, event)
        end

      :ignore ->
        :ok
    end
  end
)
```

## Handoff

`SessionRouter.handoff(server, from_key, to_route)` rebinds a conversation to another
platform's route, carrying the source session's `conversation_id` and the router's log. Since
the log is keyed by `conversation_id`, history follows the conversation across platforms.

## Supervision

`Raxol.Gateway.Supervisor` ties it together with `:rest_for_one`, so the router (which
references the sessions supervisor) restarts if that supervisor dies:

```elixir
defmodule EchoHandler do
  @behaviour Raxol.Gateway.Handler
  def init(_route, _opts), do: {:ok, %{}}
  def handle_event(%{text: t}, state), do: {:reply, "echo: #{t}", state}
end

{:ok, conn} = Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.InMemory.connect(%{sink: self()})

{:ok, _sup} =
  Raxol.Gateway.Supervisor.start_link(
    handler: {EchoHandler, []},
    deliver: fn route, rendered ->
      Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.InMemory.send_message(conn, route, rendered)
    end
  )

route = Raxol.Gateway.Route.new(%{platform: :in_memory, chat_type: :dm, chat_id: "42"})
:ok = Raxol.Gateway.SessionRouter.route(Raxol.Gateway.SessionRouter, route, %{text: "hi"})
# => receives {:gateway_sent, route, "echo: hi"}
```

## Status

The gateway core (adapter contract, routing, sessions, pairing, delivery, handoff) is
complete, the adapter contract is frozen, `Handler.Agent` (agent-backed conversations)
and `Handler.Lifecycle` (a full TEA app per chat under `environment: :gateway`) ship,
and three platforms sit behind the frozen contract: Telegram
(`Raxol.Telegram.GatewayAdapter` + `Raxol.Telegram.UpdatePoller`; text and voice notes -
keyboards, callbacks, and other media are still the TEA surface's domain), Discord
(`Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Discord` + its `GatewaySocket`; text-only this slice), and
Email (`Raxol.Gateway.Adapter.Email`; bidirectional SMTP send + RFC822 inbound via
`Email.Inbox` + `Email.ThreadStore`, with the mailbox transport injected). Voice notes
transcribe through `Raxol.Gateway.Pipeline.Transcribe`. Still deployment-supplied: the
concrete inbound-email transport (IMAP/POP/Gmail).
Any module satisfying the `Handler` callbacks works alongside the shipped handlers. See
`docs/adr/0023-unified-messaging-gateway.md`.
