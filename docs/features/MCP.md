# MCP as a Rendering Target

MCP is a rendering target alongside terminal, browser, and SSH. The Component tree is the source of truth, and MCP tools and resources are projections of it, so the same running module serves a human and an agent without either seeing a different truth. See [ADR-0012](https://github.com/DROOdotFOO/raxol/blob/master/docs/adr/0012-mcp-as-rendering-target.md) for the design rationale.

## Quick start

```bash
mix mcp.server
```

This starts an MCP server on stdio, with tools auto-derived from your app's Component tree. Wire it into Claude Code or any MCP client.

```elixir
# In your app
defmodule MyApp do
  use Raxol.Core.Runtime.Application
  # ... your normal init/update/view ...
end

# In an MCP client
session = Raxol.MCP.Test.start_session(MyApp)
session
|> type_into("search", "elixir")
|> click("submit")
|> assert_component("results", fn c -> c[:content] != nil end)
```

The agent sees a structured Component tree, not a flat screenshot. It picks the action it wants from a typed schema.

## Tool derivation

Each interactive Component implements `Raxol.MCP.ToolProvider`. The protocol exposes semantic actions per Component:

| Component    | Actions                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Button`     | `click`                                       |
| `TextInput`  | `type_into`, `clear`, `get_value`             |
| `SelectList` | `select`, `get_selected`, `get_options`       |
| `Checkbox`   | `toggle`, `get_checked`                       |
| `Modal`      | `confirm`, `dismiss`                           |
| `Table`      | `select_row`, `sort`, `get_rows`              |
| `Tree`       | `expand`, `collapse`, `select_node`           |
| `Scrubber`   | `seek`, `play`, `pause`, `get_position`       |

Add `@mcp_exclude true` to a Component's attrs to suppress tool derivation, useful for internal scaffolding Components that shouldn't show up in the agent's action menu.

## Focus lens

A Component tree with 50 Components generates 100+ tools. That's too many for an LLM to reason about. The focus lens filters to ~15 tools per interaction based on:

- Current focused Component
- Mouse hover (in `:hover` focus mode)
- Modal stack (modals shadow background Components)
- Recently interacted-with Components

```elixir
tools =
  Raxol.MCP.FocusLens.filter(all_tools,
    mode: :focused,
    focused_id: "search_input",
    max_tools: 15
  )

length(tools) # ~15, not ~100
```

The lens is attention-aware: agents see what a human would see, not a flat dump of every possible action.

## Resources

Model state is exposed as MCP resources via projections declared on the app:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp do
  use Raxol.Core.Runtime.Application

  @mcp_resource "myapp://state/cart"
  def project_cart(model), do: %{items: model.cart, total: cart_total(model)}
end
```

The MCP client can read `myapp://state/cart` to inspect what the agent is working with. Updates stream as diffs through `Raxol.MCP.Diff`, so the agent doesn't need to re-fetch the full state every turn.

## Test harness

`Raxol.MCP.Test` is a pipe-friendly test harness:

```elixir
import Raxol.MCP.Test
import Raxol.MCP.Test.Assertions

test "submit flow" do
  session = start_session(MyApp)

  session
  |> type_into("email", "user@example.com")
  |> type_into("password", "secret")
  |> click("submit")
  |> assert_component("status", fn c -> c.content == "Logged in" end)
  |> stop_session()
end
```

The harness goes through the same MCP transport as a real client, so what your tests exercise is what an agent will hit.

## Context tree

`Raxol.MCP.ContextTree` assembles a unified view of state from:

- TEA model
- Component tree (with focus lens applied)
- Active agents (`Raxol.Agent.Registry`)
- Swarm state (when distributed)
- Pending notifications

The tree is streamed as diffs over the MCP connection, so agents track changes incrementally rather than polling.

## Property tests

`Raxol.MCP.ToolProvider` is functor-law-tested: tool derivation commutes with Component composition. If you compose two Components, the derived tools are the same as the tools you'd get by deriving them separately and merging. This catches bugs where a wrapping Component would accidentally hide tools from a child.
