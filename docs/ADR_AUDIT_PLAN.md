#### 8. **Error Handling and Recovery**
- **Missing ADR**: Circuit breaker and fault tolerance strategy
- **Impact**: Enterprise reliability and supervision trees
- **Components**: ErrorHandler, ErrorRecovery, supervision strategies
- **Current State**: Implemented across core modules

### üîÑ **Low Priority - Process Decisions**

#### 9. **Documentation Architecture**
- **Missing ADR**: DRY documentation system decisions
- **Impact**: 40% redundancy reduction achieved
- **Components**: Schema-based generation, single source of truth
- **Current State**: Recently implemented with schemas and generation

#### 10. **Performance Monitoring Strategy**
- **Missing ADR**: Telemetry and metrics collection approach
- **Impact**: Prometheus integration, performance dashboards
- **Components**: Comprehensive telemetry pipeline
- **Current State**: Built-in telemetry with multiple backends

## ADR Quality Assessment

### Current ADRs Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Well-structured with clear context, decisions, consequences
- ‚úÖ Cover foundational architectural decisions
- ‚úÖ Align with current implementation
- ‚úÖ Include code examples and validation criteria

**Gaps:**
- ‚ùå Missing major features implemented after initial ADRs
- ‚ùå No retrospective documentation of WASH system
- ‚ùå Plugin system architecture not documented
- ‚ùå Enterprise features lack architectural decision context

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Missing ADRs (1-2 weeks)
1. **ADR-0004: WASH-Style Web Continuity Architecture** 
   - Document the architectural decision to implement WASH-style session continuity
   - Explain trade-offs vs traditional request/response model
   - Cover SessionBridge, StateSynchronizer, FlowEngine design

2. **ADR-0005: Runtime Plugin System Architecture**
   - Document hot reloading vs restart-based plugin systems
   - Explain sandboxing and security decisions
   - Cover dependency resolution and lifecycle management

3. **ADR-0006: Enterprise Security and Compliance Model**
   - Document audit logging architecture decisions
   - Explain encryption and key management choices
   - Cover SIEM integration and compliance features

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture ADRs (2-3 weeks)
4. **ADR-0007: State Management Strategy**
5. **ADR-0008: Phoenix LiveView Integration Architecture** 
6. **ADR-0009: High-Performance Buffer Management**
7. **ADR-0010: Comprehensive Testing Strategy**

### Phase 3: Supporting ADRs (1 week)
8. **ADR-0011: Error Handling and Fault Tolerance**
9. **ADR-0012: Performance Monitoring and Telemetry**
10. **ADR-0013: Documentation Architecture and DRY System**

## Validation Criteria

Each new ADR should:
- [ ] Document a significant architectural decision with lasting impact
- [ ] Explain the problem context and alternative options considered
- [ ] Define clear validation criteria for success
- [ ] Include references to actual implementation
- [ ] Follow the established ADR template format

## Success Metrics

**Target State:**
- üìä **ADR Coverage**: 10-13 ADRs covering all major architectural decisions
- üéØ **Alignment**: 100% of major features have corresponding ADR documentation
- üìÖ **Currency**: All ADRs reflect current implementation state
- üîó **Traceability**: Clear mapping from architectural decisions to code implementation

**Benefits:**
- **Onboarding**: New developers understand why architectural decisions were made
- **Evolution**: Clear context for future architectural changes  
- **Maintenance**: Documented rationale for complex system behaviors
- **Quality**: Architectural decision review process for new features

## Implementation Notes

### Retrospective ADRs
For WASH system and other implemented features, create ADRs with:
- Status: "Implemented" (not "Accepted")
- Date: Actual implementation date
- Validation: Current performance/success metrics
- Note: "This ADR documents a decision that was implemented prior to formal ADR process"

### Process Integration
- Make ADR creation part of feature development workflow
- Review ADRs during architecture reviews
- Update ADR index in docs/adr/README.md
- Reference ADRs in code comments for complex decisions

**Status**: üîç **AUDIT COMPLETE**  
**Priority**: üö® **HIGH** - Critical architecture lacks documentation  
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for complete ADR alignment  
**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 with WASH system ADR creation
