defmodule Raxol.UI.RegistryConformanceTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Holds `Raxol.UI.Registry` and the two package-side `type -> module` maps to
  each other.

  `raxol_mcp` and `raxol_core` cannot depend on main raxol, so
  `Raxol.MCP.TreeWalker` and `Raxol.Core.Accessibility.Projection` each hand-copy
  the map that makes tool derivation and a11y projection fire, and name Component
  modules only behind `@compile {:no_warn_undefined, ...}`. Nothing in either
  package can notice a typo'd module, a missing entry, or an entry whose module
  does not implement the behaviour the map implies -- their own suites run
  without those modules loaded, so the guards (`ToolProvider.tool_provider?/1`,
  `Provider.provider?/1`) swallow the mistake and derive nothing.

  This test runs in the main app, where every Component module IS loaded, and is
  the only thing standing between that drift and a silent ship.
