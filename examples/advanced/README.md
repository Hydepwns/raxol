# Advanced Examples

Complex examples and patterns for experienced Raxol developers. These examples demonstrate advanced concepts, performance optimizations, and architectural patterns.

## Categories

### Performance (`performance/`)
Performance optimization techniques and monitoring (currently in TypeScript directory).

### Architecture (`architecture/`)
Advanced architectural patterns and large-scale application design:
- `architecture_demo.exs` - Architectural patterns and best practices
- `cloud_integration.exs` - Cloud service integration patterns
- `dashboard.exs` - Dashboard architecture with multiple data sources
- `advanced_layout_test.exs` - Complex layout management

## Advanced Concepts

### `color_system_demo.ex`
Advanced color system management and theming.

### `ux_refinement_demo.ex`
UX optimization and refinement techniques.

### `commands.exs`
Command pattern implementation and command handling.

### `documentation_browser.exs`
Interactive documentation browser with search and navigation.

### `editor.exs`
Advanced text editor implementation patterns.

### `snake.exs`
Game development patterns and real-time updates.

### `multi_framework_demo.ex`
Advanced demonstration of using multiple UI frameworks (React, Svelte, LiveView, HEEx) together.

## Topics Covered

These examples demonstrate:

### Architectural Patterns
- **MVC/MVP patterns** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Plugin architecture** - Extensible application design
- **Event-driven architecture** - Decoupled component communication
- **State management** - Complex state handling patterns

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient rendering** - Minimize redraws and updates
- **Memory management** - Prevent memory leaks and optimize usage
- **Concurrent processing** - Handle multiple operations efficiently
- **Caching strategies** - Smart caching for better performance

### Advanced UI Patterns
- **Complex layouts** - Multi-pane and dynamic layouts
- **Real-time updates** - Live data streaming and updates
- **Accessibility** - Advanced accessibility features
- **Internationalization** - Multi-language support patterns

## Prerequisites

These examples assume familiarity with:
- Basic Raxol concepts (see [Getting Started](../getting_started/))
- Elixir/OTP patterns
- Terminal UI concepts
- Software architecture principles
