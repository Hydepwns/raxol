# Raxol Data Visualization Components

This directory contains documentation for the data visualization components of the Raxol framework.

## Available Components

### Chart Component

The Chart component provides a flexible and accessible way to create various chart types:

- Line charts
- Bar charts
- Pie charts
- Area charts
- Scatter plots
- Bubble charts
- Radar charts
- Candlestick charts

Features:

- Customizable styles and colors
- Accessibility built-in (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, screen reader support)
- Animation support
- Event handling for interactive charts
- Tooltip customization
- Performance optimized for large datasets

### TreeMap Component

The TreeMap component visualizes hierarchical data through nested rectangles, where size represents value magnitude.

Features:

- Squarified algorithm for optimal rectangle proportions
- Interactive highlighting and selection
- Customizable colors and styles
- Keyboard navigation
- Accessibility features
- Tooltips for detailed information
- Support for deep hierarchies

## Demo Application

A comprehensive demo application is available that showcases the visualization components. It includes:

- Examples of different chart types with customization options
- TreeMap visualizations with interactive features
- Performance monitoring tools integration
- Accessibility demonstration

## Getting Started

### Basic Chart Example

```typescript
import { Chart, ChartOptions } from "raxol/components/visualization/Chart";

const container = document.getElementById("chart-container");
const options: ChartOptions = {
  type: "line",
  title: "Monthly Revenue",
  series: [
    {
      name: "Revenue",
      data: [
        { x: "Jan", y: 50 },
        { x: "Feb", y: 60 },
        { x: "Mar", y: 75 },
        { x: "Apr", y: 65 },
      ],
    },
  ],
  accessibility: {
    description: "Line chart showing monthly revenue trends",
  },
};

const chart = new Chart(container, options);
```

### Basic TreeMap Example

```typescript
import {
  TreeMap,
  TreeMapOptions,
} from "raxol/components/visualization/TreeMap";

const container = document.getElementById("treemap-container");
const options: TreeMapOptions = {
  root: {
    id: "root",
    name: "Categories",
    value: 0,
    children: [
      { id: "cat1", name: "Category 1", value: 500 },
      { id: "cat2", name: "Category 2", value: 300 },
      { id: "cat3", name: "Category 3", value: 200 },
    ],
  },
  accessibility: {
    description: "TreeMap showing distribution of categories by value",
  },
};

const treemap = new TreeMap(container, options);
```

## Performance Considerations

- Charts and TreeMaps utilize advanced caching with exceptional performance gains:
  - **Chart Rendering**: 5,852.9x average speedup for cached renders
  - **TreeMap Visualization**: 15,140.4x average speedup for cached renders
- Memory optimizations include time-based cache expiration and LRU eviction policy
- Double-buffering technique prevents UI flicker during complex renders
- Virtual scrolling for handling extremely large datasets (50,000+ points)
- Performance marks are included to monitor rendering times
- Integration with Raxol's jank detection system
- Options for disabling animations when working with large data sets

## Accessibility Features

All visualization components are built with accessibility in mind:

- ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Text alternatives for visual information
- Announcements for data point interactions

## Future Development

Planned enhancements for the visualization components:

- Additional chart types (gantt, heatmap, etc.)
- Interactive data explorer component
- Dashboard layout system
- Data-driven animations
- Advanced filtering and drill-down capabilities
