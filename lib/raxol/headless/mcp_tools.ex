  MCP tool definitions for Raxol headless sessions.

  Registers `raxol_start`, `raxol_screenshot`, `raxol_send_key`,
  `raxol_get_model`, `raxol_stop`, and `raxol_list` as MCP tools
  via `Raxol.MCP.Registry`.

  ## Authorization

  The three tools that change something -- `raxol_start`, `raxol_send_key`,
  `raxol_stop` -- are annotated sensitive, so `Raxol.MCP.Server` refuses to run
  them when no authorizer is configured. The other three are reads and are not
  gated.

  The annotation is only half of it: it does nothing until an authorizer exists
  at the call site, and denies permanently if one never does. `Raxol.Application`
  supplies one (`config :raxol, :mcp_authorizer`, defaulting to `allow_all/0`
  outside production), which is what makes these annotations meaningful rather
  than merely restrictive.
