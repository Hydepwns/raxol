defmodule Raxol.Terminal.CharacterSets.Translator do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides translation logic for different character sets.

  Uses map lookups for efficient character translation based on the active set.
  Maps only store differences from the base character set (implicitly US-ASCII).
  """

  # --- Translation Maps ---
  # Define maps for character sets that have different mappings.
  # Keys are input codepoints, values are output codepoints.

  # Example: UK National Replacement Character Set (NRC)
  # Typically only changes one character: # (0x23) becomes Â£ (0xA3)
  @uk_map %{
    0x23 => 0xA3
  }
  # TODO: Define maps for other NRCs (French, German, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, etc.)
  # These often replace characters like #, @, [, ], {, }, etc.

  # Example: DEC Special Graphics
  # Maps lowercase letters and others to line drawing characters
  # See: https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/table3-13.html
  # Note: Output uses Unicode Box Drawing characters where possible.
  # Using Unicode codepoints directly for clarity.
