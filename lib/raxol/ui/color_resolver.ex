defmodule Raxol.UI.ColorResolver do
  @moduledoc """
  The single whole-list resolution pass that turns `Raxol.UI.ColorIntent`
  structs (and the `{:fixed, color}` wrapper) surviving in a cell list's
  `fg`/`bg` slots into concrete literal colors -- hex strings, `{r, g, b}`
  tuples, ANSI atoms, or 256-palette integers -- exactly once, as close to
  the terminal writer as this codebase gets.

  See `docs/core/RENDERING.md`'s "Region prominence" section for the model
  this implements.

  ## Test-ID legend

  Comments and tests below cite short IDs (`RP-N-02`, `RP-P-01`, `F2`, `A6`,
  ...) rather than re-deriving each contract inline: `RP-` is the region-
  prominence spec `docs/core/RENDERING.md` numbers negative (`N`, a
  falsifier -- something that must NOT happen) and positive (`P`, a
  guarantee) assertions under; bare letter+digit IDs (`F2`, `A6`) are that
  same document's numbered functional/architectural requirements. Each ID
  maps to one `test/raxol/ui/*.exs` `describe`/test name carrying it, which
  is the authoritative expansion of what the ID claims.

  `Raxol.UI.Layout.Engine`'s `stamp_region_prominence/2` stamps a
  per-element `region_prominence` float -- computed by
  `Raxol.UI.RegionPolicy.region_prominence/4` from the region paths present
  this frame, the focused path, and any mounted dimming overlays -- into a
  transient `{:region_prominence, p}` marker in each cell's `attrs` list
  (see `Raxol.UI.Renderer`'s per-element render step). This module reads
  that marker, composes it into `effective_p` (`own_p * region_p`), and
  fades **both fg and bg, literal or intent-resolved**, toward the frame's
  terminal ground -- mirroring `Raxol.UI.CellDim.dim_fg/2` / `dim_bg/2`
  exactly (including the `:black` fg-vs-bg sentinel asymmetry documented
  there) but parametrized by the composed `p` and a module chroma exponent
  `@region_gamma` instead of CellDim's fixed `(contrast_keep 0.45,
  chroma_keep 0.65)` pair. `@region_gamma` is the closed-form solve
  `ln(0.65) / ln(0.45)` (~0.5395), chosen to reproduce CellDim's
  `chroma_keep` to floating-point precision at the one `p`
  (`Raxol.UI.Layout.Engine`'s `@overlay_keep`, 0.45) the modal dim
  composes. See the `@region_gamma` module attribute comment for the full
  derivation and `test/raxol/ui/region_prominence_test.exs` for the golden
  (RP-N-02: 0 of 964 painted cells differ on the modal_demo fixture).

  The `{:region_prominence, p}` marker is a resolver-internal implementation
  detail, never a real cell attribute: `resolve_cells/2` always strips it
  before a cell leaves this pass (see `resolve_cell/3`), so no downstream
  consumer (buffer diff, terminal writer, MCP structured screenshot, ...)
  ever sees it. `p == 1.0` (the default, and every cell's value absent a
  mounted dialog or other de-prominent region) short-circuits every
  dimming clause to identity, so the pass is neutral (RP-P-01) whenever no
  region drops below full prominence.

  ## Local-ground bookkeeping

  Cell lists arrive **flattened** -- tree containment is already erased by
  the time `render_to_cells/2` concatenates every element's cells, and
  overlapping absolute layers make "enclosing element" ambiguous. So the
  ground a `bg` intent resolves against, and the ground a `fg` intent (or
  the legibility floor) resolves against, cannot come from containment --
  it comes from **paint order**: a sparse `%{{x, y} => resolved_bg}` grid,
  folded once over the cell list exactly as `Raxol.UI.CellManager.put_cell/2`
  and `Backends.inherit_background/2` already fold overlapping cells when
  merging into the buffer. A cell reads the grid (its own under-layer, or
  the terminal ground if nothing painted there yet) *before* resolving, and
  writes its own resolved `bg` into the grid *after* -- but only if that
  `bg` is non-`nil` (opaque). A `nil` (transparent) `bg` never writes, so a
  stack of transparent cells all fall through to the deepest painted `bg`,
  identical to how the buffer itself inherits background today.

  ## What actually resolves

    * `nil` -- the unpainted/transparent sentinel, passes through unchanged
      (and never writes the grid).
    * `{:fixed, color}` -- unwraps to `color`, exempt from everything (see
      `Raxol.UI.ColorIntent` moduledoc).
    * `%Raxol.UI.ColorIntent{}` in a `bg` slot -- resolved via
      `Raxol.UI.Theming.Salience.solve/4` against the **enclosing** ground
      (the grid's under-layer at this coordinate, else the terminal
      ground), then region-dimmed (below) -- the RESULT becomes the
      **local** ground for this cell's `fg` and for every later cell
      painted at the same coordinate. bg *intent* resolution itself has no
      prominence term -- it always resolves at the intent's own tier's
      full-strength target (`tier` defaults to `:baseline` when unset); the
      region term is layered on after, identically to a literal bg (below).
    * `%Raxol.UI.ColorIntent{}` in a `fg` slot -- resolved at
      `effective_p = clamp(intent.prominence || 1.0) * clamp(region_p)`
      (`own_p` composed with the per-cell region prominence) against the
      **local** ground (this
      cell's own region-dimmed `bg`, else the grid's under-layer, else
      terminal ground), then clamped to the intent's `:floor` class against
      the **local resolved bg's actual color** (not a synthesized gray of
      its lightness) via bisection along the same fade line.
      The floor clamp runs *after* the full `effective_p` composition, so a
      region dim can never push an already-floored color back under its
      floor.
    * Any other term (atom, hex string, `{r, g, b}`, integer, ...) -- a
      literal. Passes through completely unchanged (RP-P-01, the
      byte-identity contract) when this cell's region prominence is `1.0`;
      region-dimmed otherwise, exactly like `Raxol.UI.CellDim` dims
      literals for the modal case -- literals participate in region
      dimming, not just intents.

  ## Region prominence

  Each cell's `attrs` list may carry a transient `{:region_prominence, p}`
  marker (`p :: float() in 0.0..1.0`), stamped per-element by
  `Raxol.UI.Renderer` from `Raxol.UI.Layout.Engine`'s
  `stamp_region_prominence/2` output before cells reach this module.
  `region_prominence_of/1` reads it (default `1.0` when absent); the marker
  is *always* stripped from the emitted cell's `attrs` before it leaves
  `resolve_cell/3` -- it is never a real terminal/buffer attribute like
  `:bold` or `:dim`, only a resolver-internal composition input.

  At `p == 1.0` every dimming clause below is the identity (an explicit
  guard, not just an arithmetic no-op) -- byte-identical output, matching
  the neutrality contract that holds whenever no region drops below full
  prominence. At `p < 1.0`:

    * **fg** -- an intent's `effective_p` folds in `p` before the existing
      fade+clamp pipeline runs (so the floor clamp sees the fully composed
      prominence -- no upstream stage can push an already-floored class
      back under the floor). A literal fg fades via `region_dim_fg/3`
      -- the fg-flavored half of the CellDim mirror: a painted `fg: :black`
      is dimmed as a real color (`CellDim.dim_fg/2`'s documented asymmetry).
    * **bg** -- both an intent-resolved bg and a literal bg pass through
      `region_dim_bg/3` -- `nil` (the unpainted sentinel) and the literal
      atom `:black` (the unpainted-bg sentinel, see `CellDim` moduledoc)
      both pass through completely untouched, matching `CellDim.dim_bg/2`
      exactly.
    * Both dimming paths fade **apparent lightness toward the terminal
      ground** (`ground + (apparent - ground) * p`) and **chroma by
      `p ** @region_gamma`** -- the same two-channel OKLCH interpolation
      `CellDim.dim_oklch/4` performs, parametrized instead of hardcoded.
      `@region_gamma` is chosen so the shipped modal look survives through
      the unified formula exactly (see moduledoc intro and the
      `@region_gamma` attribute comment).

  ## Reuse, not reimplementation

  The fade/clamp math is not duplicated here. `Raxol.UI.Theming.Salience`'s
  `solve/4`, `hex_to_oklch/1`, and `apparent_lightness/3` do all OKLCH/H-K
  work; `Raxol.UI.Harness.Prominence`'s `fade/3` and `wcag_ratio/2` do the
  ground-aware fade and the external WCAG contrast check. The only new code
  here is the bisection *driver* -- adapted from `Prominence.clamp_to_floor/7`
  but walking the fade line against the LOCAL bg's real hex rather than a
  gray reconstruction of the ground's lightness.

  ## The writer guard (RP-N-03)

  `resolve_cells/2` always emits literal `fg`/`bg` for every cell -- every
  clause below terminates in a literal. `enforce_resolved!/1` is the
  defense-in-depth postcondition check run as the pass's last step: if any
  cell still carries a `%ColorIntent{}` or `{:fixed, _}` (a producer bug, or
  a code path that skipped `render_to_cells/2` entirely), it raises in
  dev/test and maps the offending slot to `:default` plus a
  `[:raxol, :ui, :color_resolver, :unresolved_intent]` telemetry event in
  prod -- fail visible-but-safe, never a crashed render in production.
