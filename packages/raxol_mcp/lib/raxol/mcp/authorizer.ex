defmodule Raxol.MCP.Authorizer do
  @moduledoc """
  The authorization seam in front of MCP `tools/call`.

  An authorizer is a 3-arity function `(tool_name, arguments, context) -> decision`,
  evaluated by `Raxol.MCP.Server` before a tool runs. `raxol_mcp` deliberately
  owns only the seam, not a policy engine: richer ALLOW/ASK/DENY logic (e.g.
  `Raxol.Agent.Authorization.Engine`) lives upstream and plugs in as a closure,
  so the engine and this enforcement point share one vocabulary without
  `raxol_mcp` depending on `raxol_agent` (which would be a dependency cycle).

  ## Decisions

    * `:allow` -- run the tool.
    * `{:ask, prompt}` -- the action needs interactive approval. What the server
      does with it depends on whether the client can be asked:
      - a client that advertised the `elicitation` capability at `initialize`
        (and has a subscribed transport) is sent a real `elicitation/create`
        request carrying `prompt`, and the call is parked until it answers;
      - anything else gets the machine-readable `authorization_required` result
        (deny-on-ASK), which is also what a decline, a cancel, an error, and a
        timeout resolve to. Only an explicit approval runs the tool.
      See `Raxol.MCP.Server`'s "Elicitation" section.
    * `{:deny, reason}` -- refuse, machine-readably.

  A `nil` authorizer means allow: a stdio transport already inherits the OS
  process boundary. The SSE transport, which exposes tools over the network, is
  guarded separately -- see `Raxol.MCP.Deployment`.

  ## Two seams: tools and reads

  `Raxol.MCP.Server` evaluates authorizers at two independent seams:

    * `:authorizer` -- guards `tools/call` (this module's original purpose).
      Receives the TOOL name.
    * `:read_authorizer` -- guards the read/metadata surfaces
      (`resources/read`, `resources/subscribe`, `resources/unsubscribe`,
      `resources/list`, `prompts/get`, `prompts/list`, `tools/list`,
      `completion/complete`). Receives the METHOD name in the tool-name
      position, e.g. `"resources/read"` with `%{"uri" => uri}` as the
      arguments.

  They are deliberately separate: a tool allowlist knows nothing about
  method names and would otherwise deny every read. On read surfaces an
  `{:ask, _}` decision resolves to deny (no elicitation for reads) and the
  prompt is not echoed to the client. Network deployments must configure
  BOTH seams: a nil `:read_authorizer` serves model state to any connected
  client, so the SSE boot guard (`Raxol.MCP.Deployment`) refuses to boot
  without one, exactly as it refuses without a tool authorizer.
