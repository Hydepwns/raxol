defmodule Raxol.MCP.Server do
  @moduledoc """
  Transport-agnostic MCP server.

  Receives decoded JSON-RPC messages, dispatches to the Registry for tool/resource
  operations, and returns response maps. Transports (stdio, SSE) call
  `handle_message/2` and write the response back over their I/O channel.

  ## Supported Methods

  - `initialize` -- MCP handshake, returns server capabilities
  - `notifications/initialized` -- client acknowledgement (no reply)
  - `ping` -- health check
  - `tools/list` -- list registered tools
  - `tools/call` -- invoke a tool
  - `resources/list` -- list registered resources
  - `resources/read` -- read a resource
  - `prompts/list` -- list registered prompts
  - `prompts/get` -- render a prompt with arguments
  - `logging/setLevel` -- set server log level
  - `completion/complete` -- auto-complete tool arguments

  ## Notifications

  The server can push notifications to connected transports. Transports
  subscribe via `subscribe/2` and receive `{:mcp_notification, map()}` messages.

  ## Elicitation

  When `Raxol.MCP.Authorizer` returns `{:ask, prompt}`, what happens depends on
  whether the client can be asked. A client that advertised the `elicitation`
  capability at `initialize` (and has a subscribed transport) is sent a real
  `elicitation/create` request; anything else gets the machine-readable
  `authorization_required` deny.

  The shape matters, because the transport seam is synchronous. `tools/call`
  returns `nil` **immediately** and the call is parked:

      client                     server                    transport
      tools/call  ------------->  ASK -> park, return nil ->  (unblocked)
                 <-------------  elicitation/create (push)
      response   ------------->  resume, return nil
                 <-------------  tools/call response (push)

  Returning `nil` is what keeps this from deadlocking: the transport's
  `handle_message` does not block, so it stays free to READ the client's
  answer. Both the prompt and the eventual response ride the subscriber
  channel, so no transport change was needed.

  A parked call is always closed, exactly once, by one of four paths: an
  approval (runs the tool), a decline/cancel/unapproved accept, an error
  response, or a timeout (`:elicitation_timeout_ms`, default 60s). Every path
  but approval resolves to the same deny -- silence is not consent.

  ## Sensitive tools

  A tool annotated `destructiveHint: true` or `sensitive: true` (see
  `Raxol.MCP.ToolDef.sensitive?/1`) must not be served without an authorizer.
  The server REFUSES TO BOOT when one is already registered, and denies at
  `tools/call` for one registered afterwards -- the boot check alone would be
  bypassable by registering late.
