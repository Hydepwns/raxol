## Notes

### Recent Improvements (v1.4.1)
- Enhanced benchmark config with statistical analysis
- Profile-based benchmark configurations
- Environment-aware performance targets
- Dynamic threshold calculation based on variance
- Comprehensive metadata tracking for benchmarks

### Edge Case Analysis
1. **ANSI Cursor Save/Restore**: Complex parsing chain issue, non-critical
2. **Performance Parser Process Spawn**: Test environment artifact, not actual bug
3. **Performance Timing**: Debug logging causes 10x slowdown in tests

### Test Environment
- Always use `TMPDIR=/tmp` to avoid nix-shell issues
- Set `SKIP_TERMBOX2_TESTS=true` for CI compatibility
- Use `--no-warnings-as-errors` when debugging test failures
