## âœ… Sprint 23+: Critical Architecture Fixes - COMPLETE

**Status**: COMPLETE (2025-09-09)
**Goal**: Fix critical cursor management architecture and remaining test failures

### Major Issues Resolved âœ…
- **Cursor Management Architecture**: Fixed fundamental issue where emulator constructor was setting cursor field to PID instead of struct
- **State Stack Tests**: All 4 tests now passing (was completely failing with KeyError)
- **Parser Performance Tests**: All 10 tests passing (fixed module reference issues)
- **Initialization Tests**: All 3 tests passing (fixed PID/struct expectations)
- **Integration Tests**: All 3 cursor position tests passing (fixed position field sync)
- **Cursor Visibility**: Fixed getter/setter to properly update emulator state
- **Erase Handler Tests**: All 4 tests passing (fixed cursor position handling)

### Success Metrics âœ…
- [x] State stack test failures resolved (4/4 passing)
- [x] Parser performance regressions fixed
- [x] Cursor management architecture corrected
- [x] Integration tests fixed (3/3 passing)
- [x] Test suite success rate: 99.6% (1077/1081 tests passing)
- [x] No performance degradation (3.3Î¼s/op maintained)

## âœ… Sprint 24: Final Test Suite Cleanup - COMPLETE

**Status**: COMPLETE (2025-09-09)
**Goal**: Fix final 4 test failures to achieve 100% test pass rate

### Issues Fixed âœ…
- [x] **Performance Test**: Process spawning count shows -1 instead of 0
  - File: `test/performance/parser_performance_test.exs:182`
  - Fix: Modified test to allow <= 0 processes (accounts for background cleanup)
- [x] **Screen Mode - Cursor Visibility**: DECTCEM mode not hiding cursor
  - File: `test/raxol/terminal/emulator/screen_modes_test.exs:165`
  - Fix: Updated DECPrivateHandler to properly update cursor struct visibility
- [x] **Screen Mode - Buffer Switching (2 tests)**: DEC mode 1047 buffer content lost
  - Files: `screen_modes_test.exs:93` and `screen_modes_test.exs:16`
  - Fix: Routed mode 1047 to ScreenBufferHandler, reset cursor to (0,0) on buffer switch

### Technical Tasks Completed âœ…
- [x] Fixed cursor position field synchronization (position, row, col)
- [x] Fixed cursor visibility setter return values
- [x] Fixed Parser module references (AnsiParser)
- [x] Fixed unused variable warnings in test files
- [x] Cleaned up unused aliases in test modules
- [x] Fixed DECPrivateHandler cursor visibility implementation
- [x] Fixed ScreenBufferHandler alternate buffer cursor reset

### ðŸ“‹ Technical Debt Backlog
**Cleanup Progress:**
- [x] Create naming convention documentation - COMPLETE
  - `docs/development/NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md` created with comprehensive guidelines
- [x] Archive old benchmark results - COMPLETE
  - Created `bench/archived/` directory for historical data
- [x] Archive temporary refactoring scripts - COMPLETE
  - Created `scripts/archived/sprint23-refactoring/` for completed migration scripts
- [x] Remove embedded JSON library (duplicates Jason) - COMPLETE
  - Verified Jason is primary JSON library, no duplicates found
- [x] Audit and clean root directory - COMPLETE
  - Removed temporary files and crash dumps
- [x] Code formatting consistency - COMPLETE
  - Applied `mix format` across entire codebase

**Remaining Tasks:**
- [ ] Migrate Process dictionary usage (20 files) - mostly test compatibility
- [ ] Review generated config files consolidation
- [ ] Archive additional development scripts (optional)

## âœ… Sprint 25-26: Final Cleanup & Documentation - COMPLETE

## Development Guidelines

### Functional Error Handling Patterns
```elixir
# Use safe_call for simple operations
case Raxol.Core.ErrorHandling.safe_call(fn -> risky_operation() end) do
  {:ok, result} -> result
  {:error, _} -> fallback_value
end

# Use with statements for pipeline error handling
with {:ok, data} <- fetch_data(),
     {:ok, result} <- process_data(data) do
  {:ok, result}
else
  {:error, reason} -> handle_error(reason)
end
```

### Architecture Principles
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Explicit error handling with Result types
- Performance-first with intelligent caching
- Comprehensive test coverage (98.7%+)
