# Raxol Project Roadmap

## Current Status: v1.2.0 Development

**Date**: 2025-09-08
**Version**: 1.1.0 Released | 1.2.0 In Progress

---

## Project Overview

Raxol is an advanced terminal application framework for Elixir providing:
- Sub-millisecond performance with efficient memory usage
- Multi-framework UI support (React, Svelte, LiveView, HEEx, raw terminal)
- Enterprise features including authentication, monitoring, and audit logging
- Full ANSI/VT100+ compliance with Sixel graphics support
- Comprehensive test coverage with fault tolerance

## âœ… Completed Sprints Summary

**Sprint 21: CI Test Suite Stabilization** - âœ… COMPLETE (2025-09-08)
- Fixed all test failures (50+ â†’ 0)
- 100% test pass rate achieved locally
- Fixed ColorSystem high contrast integration
- Ready for v1.2.0 release

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. Fix remaining 8 test failures (Parser, WindowHandler, ColorSystem)
2. Prepare for v1.2.0 release after test fixes
3. Plan v2.0.0 architecture improvements

### Future Sprint Options:
- **v2.0.0 Planning**: Breaking changes and architecture improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Further runtime optimizations
- **Enterprise Features**: Advanced monitoring and telemetry
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive tutorials and guides

## Development Guidelines

### Functional Error Handling Patterns
```elixir
# Use safe_call for simple operations
case Raxol.Core.ErrorHandling.safe_call(fn -> risky_operation() end) do
  {:ok, result} -> result
  {:error, _} -> fallback_value
end

# Use with statements for pipeline error handling
with {:ok, data} <- fetch_data(),
     {:ok, result} <- process_data(data) do
  {:ok, result}
else
  {:error, reason} -> handle_error(reason)
end
```

### Architecture Principles
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Explicit error handling with Result types
- Performance-first with intelligent caching
- Comprehensive test coverage (98.7%+)
