## Development Guidelines

### Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: Target 100% (current: 97.4% passing rate, 382/392 tests)
- **Performance**: Maintain 3.3μs parser, <1ms render, 2.8MB memory
- **Quality Gates**: All features require tests and documentation
- **No Regression**: Max 5% performance degradation allowed
- **Code Style**: Functional patterns only (no if/else), pattern matching preferred

### Development Workflow
1. **Incremental Delivery**: Each sprint produces shippable increments
2. **Quality First**: No feature merges without tests and documentation
3. **Performance Budget**: Continuous monitoring with automated alerts
4. **Community Driven**: Regular feedback and RFC process

## Development Patterns

### Essential Templates

**Test Pattern:**
```elixir
defmodule Raxol.<Domain>.<Feature>Test do
  use Raxol.TestCase, async: true
  setup :verify_on_exit!
  # Given/When/Then structure
end
```

**Performance Optimization Workflow:**
1. Measure with `bench/` benchmarks
2. Profile with `mix raxol.profile <module>`
3. Optimize (tail recursion, binary patterns, ETS caching)
4. Verify with benchmark comparison

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass (`mix test`)
- [ ] Formatting (`mix format`), Credo (`mix credo`), Dialyzer (`mix dialyzer`)
- [ ] Documentation updated, examples work
- [ ] No performance regression

### Architecture Rules
- **Terminal Layer**: No UI dependencies
- **UI Layer**: May depend on Terminal/Core  
- **Core Layer**: Independent of Terminal/UI
- **Test Helpers**: Only in `test/support/`
- **Naming**: `<domain>_<function>.ex`, avoid generic names

### Automation
```bash
# New Consolidated Mix Tasks
mix raxol help              # Show all available commands
mix raxol.check             # Run all quality checks
mix raxol.check --quick     # Quick checks (skip dialyzer)
mix raxol.test              # Enhanced test runner
mix raxol.test --coverage   # With coverage report
mix raxol.test --parallel   # Parallel execution

# Legacy Scripts (still available)
./scripts/dev.sh test       # Run tests with pattern matching
./scripts/dev.sh bench      # Benchmark with comparison
./scripts/dev.sh profile    # Profile specific module
```
