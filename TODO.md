## Development Commands

### Testing
```bash
# Quick test run (excludes slow/integration tests)
TMPDIR=/tmp SKIP_TERMBOX2_TESTS=true MIX_ENV=test mix test --exclude slow --exclude integration --exclude docker --exclude skip

# Run specific failing tests
TMPDIR=/tmp SKIP_TERMBOX2_TESTS=true MIX_ENV=test mix test test/raxol/ui/layout/table_test.exs --no-warnings-as-errors

# Run with max failures
TMPDIR=/tmp SKIP_TERMBOX2_TESTS=true MIX_ENV=test mix test --max-failures 5
```

### Quality Checks
```bash
mix raxol.check             # All quality checks
mix raxol.check --quick     # Skip dialyzer
mix raxol.test --coverage   # With coverage report
mix raxol.mutation          # Run mutation testing
```

## Quality Standards & Metrics

### Performance Targets (v1.5.0)
- Parser: <2.5μs per operation (current: 3.3μs)
- Memory: <2MB per session (current: 2.8MB)
- Render: <0.5ms per frame (current: <1ms)
- Startup: <5ms (current: <10ms)
- Test Coverage: 100% (current: 99.1%)

### Code Quality Goals
- Zero compilation warnings
- Zero dialyzer warnings
- 100% documentation coverage
- All public APIs with @spec annotations
- Property-based tests for all core modules

## Technical Debt Tracking

### High Priority
- [ ] Remove deprecated terminal config backup file
- [ ] Consolidate remaining duplicate buffer operations
- [ ] Refactor event system to use :telemetry exclusively
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest stable versions

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Migrate from custom protocols to Elixir protocols where applicable
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for all external services
- [ ] Add circuit breakers for external API calls
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns across modules

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add type specs to all private functions
- [ ] Convert configuration files to single format (TOML)
- [ ] Implement debug mode with detailed logging
- [ ] Add performance hints in development mode

## Notes

### Recent Improvements (v1.4.1)
- Enhanced benchmark config with statistical analysis
- Profile-based benchmark configurations
- Environment-aware performance targets
- Dynamic threshold calculation based on variance
- Comprehensive metadata tracking for benchmarks

### Edge Case Analysis
1. **ANSI Cursor Save/Restore**: Complex parsing chain issue, non-critical
2. **Performance Parser Process Spawn**: Test environment artifact, not actual bug
3. **Performance Timing**: Debug logging causes 10x slowdown in tests

### Test Environment
- Always use `TMPDIR=/tmp` to avoid nix-shell issues
- Set `SKIP_TERMBOX2_TESTS=true` for CI compatibility
- Use `--no-warnings-as-errors` when debugging test failures
