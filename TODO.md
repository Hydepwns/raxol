3. Address remaining process-based input buffer test issues (~10 tests)
4. Achieve 100% test pass rate
5. Prepare for v1.2.0 release
6. Document all Sprint changes for release notes

### Future Sprint Options:

## Development Guidelines

### Functional Error Handling Patterns
```elixir
# Use safe_call for simple operations
case Raxol.Core.ErrorHandling.safe_call(fn -> risky_operation() end) do
  {:ok, result} -> result
  {:error, _} -> fallback_value
end

# Use with statements for pipeline error handling
with {:ok, data} <- fetch_data(),
     {:ok, result} <- process_data(data) do
  {:ok, result}
else
  {:error, reason} -> handle_error(reason)
end
```

### Architecture Principles
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Explicit error handling with Result types
- Performance-first with intelligent caching
- Comprehensive test coverage (98.7%+)
