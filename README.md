# Raxol Terminal Emulator

> [!WARNING] > **Active Development:** Raxol is currently under active development and APIs may change. We are working towards a v1.0 release, anticipated within the next 3 weeks. Please use with caution in production environments until then.

## Features

### Advanced UI Components

- **Infinite Scroll**: Efficiently render large lists by only rendering visible items
- **Lazy Loading**: Load images only when they enter the viewport
- **Drag and Drop**: Enable reordering of items through drag and drop interactions
- **Modal**: Create dialog boxes that appear on top of the main content
- **Tabs**: Create tabbed interfaces for switching between different views
- **Accordion**: Create collapsible content sections

### Performance Optimizations

- **Rendering Optimization**: Remove unnecessary styles, combine redundant styles, optimize children
- **Update Batching**: Queue and process updates in batches
- **Render Debouncing**: Debounce render callbacks to improve performance

### Performance Monitoring

- **Memory Usage**: Track heap size and memory limits
- **Timing Metrics**: Monitor navigation, loading, and rendering times
- **Component Metrics**: Track component creation, rendering, and update times
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Visualize performance metrics in real-time

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or later
- npm 6.x or later
- Elixir 1.14 or later
- Mix (Elixir build tool)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raxol.git
   cd raxol
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   mix deps.get
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   mix compile
   ```

### Known Issues

#### Credo Warning: stdin Parsing

When running Credo, you may see the following warning:

```
info: Some source files could not be parsed correctly and are excluded:
   1) lib/raxol/terminal/input_handler.ex
```

This is a known issue with Credo's parsing of stdin-related code. It doesn't affect the functionality of the terminal emulator and can be safely ignored. For more information, see the [Terminal Module README](lib/raxol/terminal/README.md).

## Usage

```elixir
# Create a new terminal emulator
emulator = Raxol.Terminal.Emulator.new(80, 24)

# Process input
{emulator, _} = Raxol.Terminal.Emulator.process_input(emulator, "Hello, World!")

# Get the screen buffer contents
buffer = Raxol.Terminal.Emulator.get_buffer(emulator)
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
mix test
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run Credo for code quality checks
mix credo

# Run Dialyxir for type checking
mix dialyzer

# Run all pre-commit checks
mix run scripts/pre_commit_check.exs
```

### Validation Scripts

The following validation scripts are available:

- `scripts/validate_performance.exs`: Validates performance metrics.
- `scripts/validate_accessibility.exs`: Validates accessibility standards.
- `scripts/validate_e2e.exs`: Validates end-to-end tests.

These scripts can be run individually using the following command:

```bash
mix run scripts/validate_<script_name>.exs
```
