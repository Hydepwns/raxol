### Testing Improvements
```elixir

test "handles errors with proper logging" do
  import ExUnit.CaptureLog

  log = capture_log(fn ->
    assert {:error, %ArgumentError{}} = MyModule.safe_process(bad_data)
  end)

  assert log =~ "Processing failed"
end
```

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This release maintains 100% backward compatibility.

All existing try/catch patterns continue to work. The new functional patterns are opt-in and can be adopted gradually.

## Migration Guide

### Quick Start

1. **Add the alias**:
   ```elixir
   alias Raxol.Core.ErrorHandling
   ```

2. **Replace simple try/catch**:
   ```elixir
   # Old
   try do
     operation()
   rescue
     _ -> :error
   end

   # New
   ErrorHandling.safe_call_with_default(fn -> operation() end, :error)
   ```

3. **Use with statements for pipelines**:
   ```elixir
   with {:ok, step1} <- ErrorHandling.safe_call(fn -> step1() end),
        {:ok, step2} <- ErrorHandling.safe_call(fn -> step2(step1) end) do
     {:ok, step2}
   end
   ```
